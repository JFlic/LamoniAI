Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/news/graceland-university-art-department-event-protocols-announced/#top

October 15, 2020

To facilitate guest access to on-campus art events, the art department has put the following guidelines in place. These guidelines will remain in effect until it is determined changes are appropriate with consideration of CDC and Graceland guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In order to minimize the risks and potential exposure of COVID-19 for spectators, students and staff, the following protocols will be implemented.

Permitted Attendance Groups

Those who wish to attend fall semester performances will be limited to the restricted capacity for the specific performance venue. Effective Oct. 1, members of the Graceland community, student family members and interested members of the local community will be allowed to attend music performances held on campus. This includes but is not limited to current Graceland University students, faculty and staff, families of Graceland students, alumni, local supporters, as well as donors both from the local community and from elsewhere.

Required Protocol For All Events

These protocols and guidelines are subject to change as the university’s administration and COVID-19 task forces continue to evaluate COVID-19 policies and best practices. For more or updated information, follow Graceland University Visual and Performing Arts on Facebook and Twitter, and the art department on Instagram.

All questions or concerns related to these practices may be directed to Tracey Dale, VPA Administrative Assistant, atdale@graceland.eduor 641.784.5270.
