There  has been  a  good  deal  of  damage  to  black and  red  raspberries,  many  of  the canes  having  been  killed.  Peach  buds ore  prom ising. The  prospects  fo r  a la rg e f r u i t erop  are  not  quite  as good  as  last  y e a r,  th e  trees  n ot  b e­ i n g   s e t  so  fu ll  o f  b u d s  as  th ey   w ere a  year  ago. However,  there  is  an ample  num ber  of  buds  for  a  good crop  and  it  does  not-  necessarily  fol low  th a t  th e   th ic k e s t  se t  of  b u d s  will be  followed  by  tlie  most  fruir. 1 t h i n k   th e r e p o r t s t h u s   f a r   in show p r e t t y accurately the conditions th o u g h   th e r e   m a y   b e  slight  change:' ■when  the  re p o rts   a r e   in  from   a ll  The countries."

There  is  no  prospect  of  any  a t­ tem pt  lo  in su re  th e   s ta te   buildings, according  to   Jo h n (Townie, of the board  of  control. Mr. Cownie in speaking  of  th e  question said the losses as  show n  by  th e  reports  to   the board  were  too  lig h t  to  w arra n t  th e s t a t e   in  t a k i n g   o u t  policies  an d   p a y ­ in g   p rem ium s. ' I t   h a s   been  sh o w n ,' said Mr. Cownie.  ' th a t  th irty  p er cent of  th e   p re m iu m s  paid  into  a  fire  in ­ surance  com pany  is  sufficient to  cover t h e   lo sses,  th e   o th e r   seventy  p e r  ce n t going  to  the  com pany. If  any  such percentage  holds  tru e  as to the losses on  the  s ta te   b u ild in g s,  th e  s ta te   c e r­ ta in ly   w ould make  money  to  carry i t s own  insurance.'

In  h is  opinion  th e   leg­ islatu re  w ould  be  pursuing  a  poor financial  policy  if  it  directed  th a t  the stnl<\ buildings  should  be  insured,  iu view  of  th e  losses  sustained.

The  decision  not  only  applies  to   the city  of  Des  M oines,  but,  if  correct, perm its  Sunday  gam es  to  be  played in  anj'  section  of  Iow a. The  case  was brought  early  last  fall  and  tried   be­ fore  Silvara. Charles  McFarland,  one of  the  Des  M oines  pitchers,  w as  a r­ rested  on  tlie  ch a rg e   of  violating  sec1 ion  5010  of  th e   code  relative  to   Sab­ bath  breaking.

Det  Moines,  April  5.-F ro m   th e   re­ t u r n s   certified  to  the  a u d ito r   o f  s ta te by  the  county  auditors  it  is  com puted t h e   am ount  of sta te   tax  a u th o riz e d   to be  raised  for  the  general  revenue fund  by  the  levy  made  in  1000  and collectable  this  year  is  $1,404,S2S.37. This  will  be  the  proceeds  fro m   a   levy of  2 .G  mills  on  th e  to ta l  a s s e s s e d   valu­ atio n   of  the  counties,  n o t  co n sid erin g ta x e s   th a t  a re   d elin q u en t.

In  the  enactm ent r e g a r d in g the general  levy  Ior  sta te   p u rp o ses,  th e legislature  iu  1900  fixed  th e   am ount t o be  raised  for  g en eral  s ta te   p u r­ poses  at  $1,400,000. While  th e   execu­ tive  council  iixed  on  th e   levy  neces­ s a r y   to   raise  th is   sum ,  it  w as  figured out  in  the  revenue  d e p a rtm e n t  of  the a u d i to r 's  ollicc  w h at  th e   levy  should be. The  reports  from   the  auditor show  that  the  rate  w as  determ ined with  unusual  accuracy,  a  levy  of  2 0 mills  coming  within  but  SI.S2S'17  of raising  the  exact  am ount  required.

While  the  total  of  the  am o u n t  the countj  treasurers  arc  authorized  In t h e   countv  auditors  to  collect  is  $1,404.S2-'..'i7,  it is  to  be  b o rn e   in  mind t h a t not  all  of  this  will  be  collected From  experience it is  le a rn e d   the s t a t e gets  on  an  average of over ninety-eight  per  cent  of  tb e   am ount o f   th e   levy,  the  d e lin q u en t  lis t  being less  than  two  per  cent. On  th e  other hand,  the  uncollected  ta x   w ill  be  off­ s e t  by  the  am ount  of  th e  collections of  th e   tax  ferrets, lie n e e   it is  com­ puted  the  state  will  receive  th is  year alm ost  an  even  $1,400,01)0.

In  ah iitio n   to   th e  a m o u n t to be raised for general  sta te   purposes, th e re   is  a  levy  of  o n e-ten tli  o f  a  mill f o r   th e   s ta te   university  an d   o n e -te n th of  a  mill  for  the  a g ric u ltu ra l  college. These  levies  will  raise  $34,U31.*.il  for each  institution.

In  a  short  tim e  the  m a tte r   of  com­ puting  the  levy  to  be  fixed  by  th e   cx(  c u t n e   council  th is  y e a r,  th e   proceeds from which  will  be  collected  iu  1902. will  lie  taken  up. On  o r  b efo re  the th ird   Monday  in  June  th e  co u n ty   au­ ditor-.  are  required  to   tr a n s m it  to   th e s t . i t c   a u d ito r,  a b s tr a c t s   o f  th e   a s s e s s ­ ment  in  tlieir  respective  counties.  The second  Monday  in  July  th e  executive council will meet as  a  board  of equalization  and  equalize  th e  assess­ ments  between  the  counties. Before t h e first Monday  in Vugust  the  re­ s u l t s   will  have  to  be  c e rtifie d   b ack   to t h e county  auditors The  executive council  can  then  fix  1lie  ra te   of  the levy. Tlie  am ount  to   lie  levied  for general  state  purposes  th is  y ear  and collected  in  1002  is  $1,500,000,  o r  $100,000 more than  the  am ount  to  be raised  by  the  lax  collections  of  the y e a r   1901.

This  year  a  real  e s ta te   assessm ent is  required  by  law. It-  i.s  expected th e r e   will  lie  a  larg e  in c re a s e   in   th e valuation  or  irn l  n.nd  otlioi'  p ro p erty , and  although  the  sta te  w ill  levy  $100,000 more  general  revenue,  y et  it  is believed  a  rate  of  2 0  m ills,  th e   same ns  the  rule  now  in  force,  w ill  be  suf­ ficient. In  Ihc  revenue  departm ent of  Auditor  M erriatn's  office,  it  is  cal­ culated  it  will  not  be  n ecessary   to raise  the  levy  from  th e  p re s e n t  ra te in  order  to  get,  $1,500,000  on  th e   in­ creased  valuation  of  p ro p erty .

## EXPLANATION  BY  RUSSIA

## Says  She  Has  No  Intention  of  Hold­ ing  Manchuria.

Washington,  April  0.-The  United States  government  has  received  a communication  from  the  governm ent of  R u ssia  of unusual im portance, bearing  on  conditions  in  China,  and particularly   those  relating  to   M an­ churia. Tlie  document  is  of  such  a character  as  to  have  produced  a  pro­ foundly  favorable  im pression  and  a t the  s tu le   d ep artm en t  it  is  looked  up­ on  a s   th e   m ost  s a lu ta ry   developm ent t h a t   h a s occurred  for  m any  m onth? in  th e   problem s  of  th e  cast..

While  there  is  an  entire  absence  ol authoritativ e  inform ation,  y e t  it  is understood  th a t  Russia  now   takes occasion  to  give  positive  assurance of  llie   d isin terested   se n tim e n ts  w hich have  anim ated  her  throughout  the consideration  of  the  Chinese  ques­ tions. As  to  M anchuria,  it  is  m ade clear  th a t  Russia's  course  never  has varied  in  the  purpose  to  leave  th a t province,  an  integral  p art  of  China and  to   re tire   the  Russian  tro o p s  as rapidly'  as  safely'  would  perm it. This, moreover,  it is made plain  in  flic  com­ munication,  has  been  Russia's  course th ro u g h o u t, not w ithstanding asser­ tio n s  to   th e  c o n tra ry . But  as  signal evidence  of  Russia's  purpose,  and  in harm ony  with  the  czar's  aspirations for  peace  and  harm ony  betw een  the nations,  the  Russian  governm ent  now gives  assurances  of  1he  m ost  definite and  satisfactory'  character  as  to   th e execution  of  this  purpose. The  ex­ t e n t of  the  assurances  can  b est  be judged  by'  the  impression  m ade  in th e   h ig h e st,  official  q u a rte rs   h e re   t h a t flic  th re a te n e d   crisis  over  M anchuria has  been  completely'  averted.

Tho  Russian  communication  is  the more  significant  coming  at  a  m om ent when  th e   press  advices  from   E urope asserted  1 lint Russia  was  collecting an  a rm y   of 100 , 00(1 men  for  th e   p u r­ pose  of  holding  Manchuria  w ithout reference  to  the  desires  of  th e   o th e r powers.  There  is  no  doubt  th a t  R us­ sia lia s  a  large  m ilitary   force  in  M an­ churia.  so  that,  had  she  determ ined to   h o ld   th e   province,  she  h as  th e   m il­ i t a r y establishm ent  already  on  the ground  prepared  to  m aintain  h e r  occupa ney.
