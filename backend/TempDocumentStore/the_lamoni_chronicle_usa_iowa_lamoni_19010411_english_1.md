The death of the heroic  Colonel Dailey came while  Judge Smith  McPherson was congressman  from this district, and it  was  a  pleasure  to  the  then Judge  Smith  to comfort the  last days of the old  war  horse  with  the assurance that  he  would  use his in­ fluence  with  McPherson  to  secure the appointment of  the son,  George, to  West Point,  little  dreaming  that the authority  would  rest in his own hands in so  short  a  time. But op­ portunity  came  to  Judge  Smith  to fulfill his obligation to his dead friend, and the  people  of  this  district and the state will approve his course and honor him  for  his  display  of grati­ tude.

LAMONI. IOWA, APRIL 11 , 1901 .

NO. 4*3

Tue  following taken from  the State  Register  is  worthy of  consid­ eration,  and  we  think  all  good  Re­ publicans  in  Decatur  county should carefully  consider  before  attem pt­ ing  to  precipitate a  factional  strife iu the party:

## NO  DEADLOCK METU0DS.

'Chariton Patriot1 We  note, with regret,  in  some of  the Republi­ can papers  of  the  state a  tendency toward extreme  action  on  the  part of the friends  of  the  different candi­ dates  for  governor. Already  we read of  threats  to  deadlock  the con­ vention  rather  than  that  any of the candidates now prominent should  be nominated. We  believe  that  Ne­ braska  methods  will  not find  favor in  an  Iowa Republican  state conven­ tion. No man  has  a  lien  upon  the nomination, and  no  one  who  a t­ tempts  to  organize a  bitter factional fight within  the  party  is  worthy of consideration and support. I t should be tbe rule in every county  to select  conservative  men,  who  have the good of  the  party  at  heart,  and send  them uninstructed  to the state convention  as  delegates,  thus  leav­ ing them  unembarrassed  in  the ex­ ercise  of their  best  judgment  by previous  pledges. I t has  been  a time  honored custom in Lucas county for  the  Republicans  to send uninstructed delegations to the state convention. Without a marked badge of  instructions  they  have  al­ ways  been  able  to  assist  freely  in the  selection  of  the  best  possible ticket,  and have never failed in loyal support of the party  nominees. The Republican  party  is  a  great  power in  Iowa,  but only  because,  in  the ex­ ercise  of  th at  power,  it  has  been faithfully  mindful  of  the  best inter­ ests of the  state. By  reason  of  its decisive  majorities  it  has  assumed the  x'esponsibility  of  administering the  affairs  of  a  splendid  common­ wealth,  and the successful and satis­ factory  manner  in  which  tbe  grave responsibilities  have  been  met  con­ stitutes  its  only  valid  claim  upon tho  suffrages  of  the people. Wc trust,  therefore,  that  in  the interest of  good  government,  as  well as  the well-being  of  the  party, that  wise conservatism,  sound  common  sense and  a  broad  catholic  spirit  will  be the dominating forces in  the corniDg Iowa Republican state convention.

So many strong arguments for the indorsement of the Republican  ticket were available  in  the  last  national campaign  that  some  were  slighted. One achievement of  which little was said  was  the settlement  of tho Paci­ fic debt by  the  payment  to  the  gov­ ernment of almost tbe entire amount, principal and interest. The sum due was $130,000,000,  and  the treasurer has received $12G,000,000 in its liquid­ ation. One  small  lien  remains  on which the sum  of  $1,872,000  will  be realized. It  was  not  until  President McKinley  took  hold  of  affairs  that the idea or  saving  the  whole of this debt  was seriously entertained Plans to get half of  it  were talked of in  foriper Congresses.  But President McKinley and  his cabinet pushed  the matter  with  groat vigor  and  the finest perception of opportunity,  aud the result is  payment  practically in full.

## F r o m  t h e  K e lle r to n   G lo b e .

The 'Consolidated Telephone Co.,' which is to  be  organized  as  soon as 100 shares of $10 each are subscribed proposes  to  put  in  a  central  ex­ change  in  which  the  running  ex­ penses  are  to  be  equally  divided among all users  whether  in  town or country. I t   is  hoped  th a t  a  thour; sand phones  will  be  connected  with the exchange by tbe end of the year.

When Cervera's fleet dashed out at Santiago much  was  said of 'McKin­ ley's  luck." The  luck  consisted  in the fact  that  our  fleet  was  in  the right place and  ready. The  Philip­ pines problem  in  its  various  stages has illustrated  the luck  and the com­ paratively small  losses  there during two years and  a  half  of war are an­ other proof. Many  Democratic  ed­ itors say  th at the prevailing national prosperity  is merely due  to the luck of a succession of good crops and the  unexpected  increase in gold pro­ duction. A review of the last Demo­ cratic administration is of little value as a study  in  luck. The  Democratic party is  the reverse cf lucky. When it is  running  affairs  Uncle  Sam  is down on his  luck,  and even  the din­ ner  pail  emitB a hollow sound. Some day the  historical  analyst will bring his  threads  together  and  the word  'luck'  used  in  this  connection will  be  changed  to  'good  manage­ ment."

## The  BllHan-Dollar  Steel  Trust. F r o m   t h e  A m e r ic a n  E c o n o m is t.

In order to  familiarize  the mind of the reading public with the idea that Protection  must  go  and Free-Trade must' come,  the editors of Free-Trade newspapers find it necessary to print some rather  remarkable  statements. For  example,  the  following, from the New York  'Journal'-

'The labor cost of  making steel in the United  States  is  less  than  half the labor cost in  Great Britain. But the  Tariff  duties  collected  by  tbe Billion Dollar  Steel  Trust  are  to 'Protect  American labor.' "

Used  in  this  sense  the words 'labor  cost'  are  misleading,  and purposely  so. Wages  in  iron  and steel production are very  much higher in  the  United  States  than  in Great  Britain;  they  are  nearly dou­ ble  what  they  are  in  Germany. In this  country  labor  cost  is  reduced, not  by  reducing  wages, as  is  now being done all over Free-Tiade Great Britain in  the  iron  and  steel  trade, but by  employing  additional  capital in  the shape of labor saving machin­ ery, methods and devices.  Protection made this  possible  by  guaranteeing a  m arket  for  the  output. But Pro­ tection  has ceased to be useful  to the iron and  steel  industry  as  repre­ sented  by  the  billion  dollar  trust, though  it  is  as  necessary  as  it  ever was  to  the large number of establish ments  operating  independently  and outside  tho trust establishments which now  employ  many  thousands of  wage earners,  but  which  would  be smashed  out  of  existence  by  FreeTrade  iu  iron  and  steel  products. Possibly  this  explains  why  the  bil­ lion  dollar trust  would  be quite  will­ ing to have  iron  and  steel  placed  on the free  list. That  is  substantially the  tru st  attitude  today. However th a t may  be,  it  is  foolishly  false  for the  New  York  'Journal'  to  assert th a t Tariff duties are collected  by  the billion dollar steel trust. That gigantic  concern  collects  no  duties and is  in  no  way  affected  by  or dependesri: upon the Tariff.

## Make  Fuel  of  Hay  and  S traw . F r o m   t h e   C h ic a g o   R c c o r U - H o r a ld .

St.  Paul,  April 3.-Users of  fuel  in the  West,  especially  in  the  farming communities, are  watching  with  in­ terest the  experiments  of  S.  Ogdeu Edison,  an  uncle  of  Thomas  Edison, the inventor,  in  an  attem pt  to  find some  way  of  converting  the  hay, straw  and  corn  stalks  into  a  con­ venient form for fuel. On the prairies,  where  wood  is  not  to  bo found,  and coal  is  a luxury,  hay and such light fuel  have  been  forced  into use. Specially designed  stoves have worked quite  successfully. But the invention of  Edison  will  revolution­ ize  the  enlire  fuel  question  of  the West. Not  long  ago  he  conceived the  idea  of  preparing  these  light substances  in  blocks  of  convenient size  th a t could  be  used  the  same as chunks of wood. He has stated to  a South Dakota  friend  that  plants  for the  manufacture  of  his  straw  fuel can  be  erected  for  about  $15,000, which  will have  a  capacity  for mak­ ing fifty  tons  per day.

The  fuel  will  be  in  the  shape  of round  sticks,  nine  to  twelve  inches in  diameter  aud  two,  four  and  six feet in  length. The material  will  be as  hard  as  wood,  and  last longer and make  a  better  heat  than  soft coal. One such plant will utilize  the straw, hay and corn  stalks of  a community ten  miles  square. It  will  use  weeds as  well  as  straw. The  cost of mak­ ing the  fuel  viH  be much  less  than the present cost  per ton  of  coal. It is  stated  th at the invention  is  backed by  a  strong  company,  which  pro­ poses  to put in  plants  for the manu­ facture of this  sort  of fuel  whenever an  opportunity affords.

The Ohio Central aud Hocking Val­ ley  railroads  baye  named  the junc­ tion  of their  lines  just  south of To­ ledo,  Funston,  in  honor  of the Kan­ sas  Hero. If  Funston  only  keeps his mouth  shut,  and  does  not  talk himself  to  death,like  certain  other war heroes have  done,  he will  be all right.

## The Qrace  of  Gratitude.

F r o m   t h e   T ow a  S t a t e   R e g i s t e r .

Fontanelle Observer: Congressman Smith has appointed  George Dailey, of Council Bluffs,  to  the West Point Military  AcademyThe  young man is the  son  of the late Colonel Dailey, of that city,  and whose fighting blood  is  well  known to  the people  of  Iowa. There  can  be  no just  criticism  of  Judge  Smith's ac­ tion in making the appointment from ■his own  county  when  the  facts are known. When  Judge  Smith  was a lad just out  of  school,  and teaching in  the country at  $35  per month,  he he was summoned  to  the  office of Colonel Dailey  and  asked by  th at eminent lawyer  if  he would not like to  enter  the  office  and  study law. The  young  teacher  replied  that be would like  very  much  to do so,  but that he had not  the  financial means to  sustain  himself  while  studying. The  matter was  settled  by  Colonel Dailey volunteering au  agreement to pay him $20  per  month. From this beginning there  resulted  a partner­ ship  and a more enduring friendship.
