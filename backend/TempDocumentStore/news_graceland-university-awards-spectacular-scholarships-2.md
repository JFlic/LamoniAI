Graceland University awarded $122,000 in prestigious scholarships to Spectacular campers last week. Spectacular, or Spec, is the largest annual gathering of youth in Community of Christ, Graceland’s sponsoring church. Over 1,000 campers and their leaders gather at Graceland University, where they have opportunities to participate in leadership and discipleship development, diverse worship, and expression of arts, music and sports. The scholarships awarded at Spec are announced at the end of the week-long camp and are available to students entering their senior year of high school and participating in the camp.

InSpire Scholarship

The InSpire Scholarship is intended for students who are passionate about the mission of Community of Christ and are committed to continuing that interest while pursuing their education at Graceland University. The Graceland community provides many opportunities to promote the important work of the church’s mission initiatives – the InSpire Scholarship is offered in order to encourage Community of Christ students to attend Graceland and pursue those opportunities. Scholarships ranging from $1,000 to $2,000, renewable for 4 years, are awarded on a competitive basis each year at Spec.

Jaclynne Brown, Central Mission – $1,500 renewable for 4 years = $6,000Alexis Frazier, South Central States – $1,500 renewable for 4 years = $6,000Adelaide Simpson, Central Mission – $1,500 renewable for 4 years = $6,000

Wallace B. Smith Leadership, Arts and Sports Grant

Wallace B. Smith was president of Community of Christ, Graceland’s sponsoring church, from 1978 to 1996. The scholarships named in his honor go to young men and women who show the promise to make a significant contribution to the Graceland campus by modeling the university’s three core values: learning, wholeness and community. In addition to one $3,000 scholarship, Graceland offers additional scholarships ranging from $1,000-$2,500, renewable for up to four years, to Spec campers who have distinguished themselves within at least one of the university’s three core values.
