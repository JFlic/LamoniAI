Save Your Spot for Fall 2025 on the Lamoni Campus

Graceland University believes in the shared responsibility of family, government and the institution for facilitating a student’s attendance at the college or university that best meets their intellectual, emotional, spiritual, physical and social needs.

Your college education will be one of the most important investments you and your family make. Financial aid can help you bridge the gap between your own resources and the cost of education. We emphasize bridging the gap because you and your family are primarily responsible for your college expenses. Graceland University Student Financial Services makes every effort to assist you and your family in obtaining the financial aid funds that you may need to meet expenses if your family’s resources are not adequate.

Students must apply for financial aid each year by filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and submitting other required forms. Federal aid awarded by Student Financial Services is not automatically renewed. You will need our Federal School Code, which is 001866, to complete the FAFSA.

To complete the FAFSA, go tostudentaid.gov.

Awards are made on a first-come, first-served basis. Although students can apply for financial aid throughout the year, funding for some financial aid programs may be depleted prior to May 1 for the upcoming academic year.

Your FAFSA should be submitted as soon as possible after Jan. 1.

Federal student aid through the Department of Education is available for qualifying students in the form of

To begin the process for determining your eligibility for federal aid,file your FAFSA.

Graceland offers a number of federal loans. Some are based upon financial need as defined by the U.S. Department of Education, and other loans are available without a demonstrated need. The major types of federal Title IV loans are

In order to obtain these loans, certain steps must be followed.

To receive the subsidized and/or unsubsidized loans,

Upon graduation or withdrawal from school, students will need to completeexit counseling. For Direct Loans, this can be completed online atexit counseling.

Employment as a student is a learning experience and a means to develop and enhance positive values regarding work and service.

You will learn time management, employee responsibility and, in some cases, gain leadership experience all while earning money to help finance your stay at college. Your job on campus is a real job. It affects the day-to-day operations of the university and the quality of our service to the students, families, staff and faculty that make up our Graceland community.

Funding for Graceland’s student employment program comes from the Federal Work-Study Program (FWS) and from Graceland University funds. Student employment is considered a type of financial aid.

Federal Work-Study is a need-based employment program for citizens and permanent residents of the United States or eligible non-citizens. To apply,file your FAFSA. You are notified of your eligibility for FWS on the award notice issued to you from Student Financial Services. Eligibility for FWS does not guarantee employment. It is your responsibility to interview with prospective campus employers and accept employment. The maximum FWS award you can earn depends on your financial need and other financial aid you may be receiving.

Student employment funded by the university may be available regardless of your financial need.

Specific to International Students:As an F-1 immigration status international student, you are only allowed to work on campus without specific immigration authorization. Contact the Graceland Intercultural Office about eligibility and the off-campus employment authorization process. If you choose to work on campus and there is sufficient room in your educational budget, there is a 10-hour-per-week work eligibility. International students may not work more than 20 hours a week without violating their student visa. Most students use the money they earn for miscellaneous expenses. To obtain an institutional employment position, you need to complete the online student employment application, work with the director of the Intercultural Office to complete required government forms and work with the Student Employment Coordinator to locate possible positions. After being hired, report to the Intercultural Office to make arrangements to apply for a U.S. social security number if you do not already have one. Graceland University cannot guarantee a position to any student, as positions are limited.

Students must qualify for employment each academic year. To be employed as a student you must:

It is also to your advantage to establish priority eligibility for hiring by filing the FAFSA.

Upon completion of the student employment application, copies of the application will be forwarded to various departments. You may be contacted for interviews; please be prompt in responding. Once you are hired, you are required to provide proof of eligibility to work in the United States (e.g. a birth certificate, social security card, passport or alien registration card). You must also complete theI-9 Form,W-4 Formanddirect deposit authorization form. These may be obtained online or from the Human Resources Office.

Most student positions require that you work five to 10 hours per week while classes are in session. Most students are allowed to work 10 hours total per week. There are also positions that have an irregular schedule where you may work as needed. With only a few exceptions, student employees are paid the federal minimum wage.

When your supervisor’s request to hire you has been approved and you have your application and payroll forms on file in the Human Resources Office, you will be set up to do time entry online.

Community service jobs, funded by the Federal Work-Study Program, are designed to improve the quality of life for the community residents or solve particular problems related to their needs. Graceland University has contracted with the Lamoni Community School, Funshine Daycare and the Lamoni Public Library to provide a limited number of community service work-study jobs for Graceland students. These off-campus positions are available only to students who qualify for Federal Work-Study. To apply for one of these positions you must first contact Student Employment.
