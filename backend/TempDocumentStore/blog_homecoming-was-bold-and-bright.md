“You guided me all day long,Let all the strains of joy now mingle in my song,The joy that flows, the joy that sweeps,The joy that sits still and knows not any word…”– “You Guided Me” by Michael John Trotta

Each year after Homecoming, I get a sense of melancholy when the weekend is over. The buzz of people moving from amazing event to amazing event subsides, and life returns to its normal pace on our campuses. On Saturday night, I sat awestruck in theShaw Family Auditorium, witnessing choir members of the past join our current students to sing, “You Guided Me” by Michael John Trotta. This song, an anthem under Dr. Blessing’s direction, once again moved me greatly as the words resonated in my ears.

The joy that Trotta writes of –that flows, that sweeps, that sits still and knows not any word– is the joy I feel as I reflect on such a beautiful weekend.

Our theme forHomecomingwasBe bold. Be bright.And I cannot imagine a better way of describing how it felt to be among you once again. The stories that you share with me, whether at Homecoming or elsewhere, are the lifeblood of Graceland. They are stories full of bold action and bright optimism. They are reflections of this institution that we love. As we gather, I am continuously reminded of our shared story, which guides us as we chart our bold path forward.

Thank you for being a part of Graceland. Whether you were able to join us in person, or if you celebrated with us from afar, your presence is always felt.
