This accomplishment marks Graceland’s third year in a row of ranking as a first tier Midwestern university.

Highlights from theReport’s standings include mention of Graceland’s small class sizes, with 74.4 percent of classes containing 20 or fewer students; our financial aid services, with 62.4 percent of undergraduate students receiving need-based financial aid and the average need-based scholarship or grant coming in at $14,979; our admissions process, which the ranking dubbed “selective”; and a unique 4-1-4 academic calendar that provides students opportunities to participate in “Winter Terms.”

A Reputation for Academic Excellence

The rankings also noted Graceland’s student services, including everything from non-remedial tutoring to health services to safety precautions. Maintaining a 15:1 student to faculty ratio augments theReport’srankings as an important way for prospective students and parents to not only discover Graceland, but to compare it with other esteemed universities.

“This ranking shows that Graceland offers excellent academic programs that can compete with anyone,” said Graceland President Dr. John Sellars. “This really validates the progress we’ve made over the last few years, and our continued appearance on theReport’s list is giving us an excellent reputation.”

Schools in four regions were ranked as first or second tier schools byU.S. News & World Report,an annual benchmark of colleges and universities that provide high school students and their parents an excellent starting point in their college search. The rankings reveal quality institutions, ranked by widely accepted indicators like retention, graduation rates, quality of faculty, and the “feel” of campus life.

The rankings noted that Graceland’s most popular majors include Education, Health Professions and related programs, and Business, Management, Marketing and related services. The Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education and the Graceland School of Nursing were also recently recognized byU.S. News and World Report’sBest Online Programs, ranking No. 5 in the Best Online Bachelor’s Programs and No. 11 in Best Online Graduate Education Programs. With strong rankings in a variety of categories, Graceland is developing a strong reputation for academic excellence and establishing itself as one of the best choices available for students of the future.

“Graceland’s regional universities ranking withU.S. News, in addition to the online teacher education program being ranked 11th in the nation, is indicative of the measures the Gleazer School of Education has taken to become known as the best teacher preparation center in the Midwest. Keeping on the cutting edge and delivering rigorous and meaningful programs to students increases the opportunity for continued national recognition,” said Tammy Everett, Dean of the Graceland School of Education.
