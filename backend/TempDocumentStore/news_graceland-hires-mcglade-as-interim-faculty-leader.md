McGlade brings decades of experience leading academic affairs.

June 28, 2024

Interim PresidentJoel Shrock, PhD, announced that the University hired Jacqueline McGlade, PhD, to the post of Interim Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty. McGlade will serve in the position on an interim basis, helping to support the University’s faculty, filling the role vacated by Shrock when he was named Interim President.

“I am thrilled for Dr. McGlade to join Graceland at this pivotal time,” said Shrock. “Her extensive experience at institutions around the world will help us continue leading from the front as an innovative academic leader.”

McGlade graduated with a degree inHistoryand Political Science and then achieved her Master’s degree in History and Communications Studies, both from the University of Nebraska Omaha. Her PhD in American Studies came from The George Washington University, with her dissertation titled, “The Illusion of Consensus: American Business, Cold War Aid, and European Economic Reconstruction, 1948-1958.”

She comes to Graceland having most recently served as Interim Vice President for Academic Affairs at Wheeling University in West Virginia, where she led academic operations, oversaw curriculum development and programs accreditation, and provided oversight of the university’s re-accreditation efforts with the Higher Learning Commission.

Dr. McGlade shared her excitement, “I am excited to join Graceland University in the coming year to lead academic affairs. I have worked with institutions much like Graceland and am thrilled to join a school so close to home. Dr. Shrock has set a great table for progress and innovation with the faculty, and I look forward to working with the professors and staff at Graceland to carry its mission forward.”

Graceland engaged The Registry to fill this position, which places administrators for interim postings should the need arise. McGlade was selected by the university’s search committee, which contained representatives from faculty, staff, and administration.

“Dr. McGlade stood out with some very specific experience that will be beneficial to Graceland going into the coming years,” said Shrock. “Her abilities to manage accrediting bodies and to lead faculty through the process will be critical for us as we go through our regular HLC assessment in 2027.”

McGlade begins on July 8 and will spend time in Lamoni and in the Kansas City area at the Independence campus and Graceland’s site in Mission, Kan., which houses itsDoctor of Physical Therapyprogram as well as the university’s subsidiary,SkillPathSeminars.
