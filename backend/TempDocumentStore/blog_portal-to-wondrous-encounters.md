The Frederick Madison Smith Library

Gabriel Chrisman, MLIS

Entering the building, you are greeted by a lineup of books on current affairs — thoughtfully compiled byLIBRARIES DIRECTOR GABRIEL CHRISMAN, MLIS. Although he commutes daily between the Victorian era and contemporary times, he positioned Graceland’s campus libraries as a modern service provider for all research and study or plain reading pleasure needs. The library doors are open to the community beyond campus: Chrisman invites everyone to take advantage of the available databases, interlibrary loan platforms and his personal bibliophile network to source that special book or publication. Whenever a fascinating topic lends itself, a diverse audience gathers for a lecture series by a guest presenter or Chrisman himself — with a timelessly refreshing sense of humor and his passion for all things Victorian, from mechanical features to mythological creatures.

Jim Redmond, PhD

Like Chrisman,DIRECTOR OF ACADEMIC SUPPORT LABS AND TUTORING JIM REDMOND, PhD, wants the library to serve multiple purposes: create a welcoming space with its designated tutoring rooms for scheduled sessions and emergency walk-ins, but also be wherever its services are needed to “help students survive, strive, and thrive.” Redmond’s tutoring team reaches out across campus to meet students where they’re at, both in terms of location — from the classrooms to Newcom Student Union to the residence halls — and their academics. Throughout the semester, he organizes events where students can receive individual guidance with subject learning or writing and composition in a relaxed communal atmosphere — and with thoughtfully presented snacks and drinks for the just as vital soul food, especially during crunch times.
