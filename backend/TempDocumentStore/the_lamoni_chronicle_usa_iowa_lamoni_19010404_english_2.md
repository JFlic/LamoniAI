On  Saturday  evening,  near  eight o'clock,  the  dread  alarm of  the  fire bell  was  heard,  and  soon  a  crowd fjivas  gathered opposite the block con­ taining  the post office  and Geo. Johnson's  jewelry  store. Mr. W.  J. Mather,  who lives over the pdesfrofiice detected  the smell o f ,  something burning,  and  went to the  post  office below,  but found  all  right  there,  re­ turning  up  stairs  he  saw  fire  in  a closet  in  Mr.  Johnson's  apartments. By the  prompt  application  of  water the fire was put out before the engine could  be  got  to  work. With, com­ mendable  promptness  the  firemen dragged  the engine  through the deep mud and were ready for  work. Sev­ eral of the fire boys soon  found them­ selves  minus  their overshoes  lost  in mud. Thus was averted what might have been a destructive  fire. I t   ap­ pears Johnson's  son  had  been  in  the closet  with  a  light  half  an  hour  be­ fore the  fire  was  discovered. About $50 dollars worth of clothing was de­ stroyed. During  the  confusion  our postmaster  remained  a.t  his  post, planning  in  his  mind  the  saving  of the  office  contents  in  case of  neces­ sity.
