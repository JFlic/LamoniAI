# Honoring the Legacy of Graceland's Nancy Wallace

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/news/remembering-graceland-legend-nancy-wallace/#top

December 15, 2017

Wallace obtained her master’s degree in social work from the University of Iowa, which prepared her for a career in counseling and teaching. She worked for Graceland for over 30 years – as an academic advisor, career counselor, professor and as alumni director. Her dedication and service to the university was remarkable. After retiring from Graceland, Wallace continued to teach part time but also had time to enjoy antiques, furniture and gardening.

Wallace was known for laughter and sparkle as well as her ability to sincerely listen. When friends and family gathered in Lamoni in October to celebrate her life, Michael Lewis ’90 shared these beautiful words of his dear friend.

“In the lush symphony that was Nancy’s life, she was sometimes the piccolo, dancing like a lambent fairy about the score. She was sometimes the rich, intimate voice of a viola or an oboe, sharing her deepest joys and woes with authenticity and risk. And when she was at her very best, when the symphony got to its most intense and austere, Nancy was a cowbell, clanging and banging along with no concern for the score except she knew it neededher bell.Because her music was her own, and if you didn’t like it, you most likely had wandered into the wrong recital.”

“Her approach was peace through mischief, and she was Ghandi-like in the generous blessings of mischief she bestowed upon the world …The life that was Nancy moves back now into star-shine and firecracker, living as it always did as a throbbing continuous beat within the cosmos of energy that enwraps us all.”
