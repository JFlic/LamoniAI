# Doctor of Nursing Practice Degree | Graceland University

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/academics/academic-catalogs/graduate-catalog-home/doctor-of-nursing-practice/#top

The DNP degree is offered in direct response to the October 2004 endorsement of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) position statement which recognizes the DNP as the preferred credential for all advanced nursing practice roles. The DNP program fulfills a strong local, regional, and national need for doctoral prepared advanced practice nurses and is designed to be in full compliance with professional standards for the practice doctorate as put forth by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN).

The DNP degree expands and enhances the focus of nursing practice, using as its foundation the basic baccalaureate nursing program and Master’s level preparation in nursing or a related field. The program’s goals are directed toward educating experienced nurses functioning in direct or indirect healthcare roles. The post-Master’s DNP degree consists of 31 semester hours (s.h.) of coursework delivered online within a 16 week trimester schedule and includes a minimum of 636 practice hours and field experiences.

The DNP degree program requires documented completion of a minimum of 1,000 post-BSN supervised practice hours. DNP practice hours include verified practice hours from the Master’s POS, field experiences in selected DNP courses, individualized advanced practice experiences completed in the student’s home community, and the completion of a faculty supervised and peer-reviewed Practice Improvement Project. Students admitted with documentation of fewer than 400 post-BSN supervised practice hours must enroll in NURS8950 Advanced Practice in Organizational Leadership to complete necessary practice hours to meet the 1,000 post-BSN practice hours requirement for the DNP degree.

ThePost-graduate Nurse Educator certificate (12 s.h.)may be added to the DNP programs of study. This option ishighly recommended for anyone teaching currently or interested in doing so in the future. All or part of the 12 s.h. may be completed during or after completion of the MSN or DNP degree. Addition of the NE certificate does not delay or extend degree completion and time to graduation.
