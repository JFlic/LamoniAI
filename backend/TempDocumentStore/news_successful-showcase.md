Graceland Theatre took the stage and delivered an all-round great performance at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival

February 14, 2024 | jns

KCACTF is an important initialism on the calendar of a theatre arts student. The Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival is a national theater program that provides college and university students a stage to showcase their talent, share their work and improve their craft.

Each year, eight Regional Festivals and the National Festival in D.C. promote, recognize and foster the wide range of theatre arts, from design and technology over directing and dramaturgy to performing and playwriting.

In January,Graceland University Theatrerepresented this full range of talent and creativity at theKCACTF Region Vevent in Des Moines. Region V comprises the states of IA, KS, MI, MO, NE, ND, SD.

For one intensive week, the Graceland troupe participated in workshops covering writing/stage combat/dance/auditioning, attended invited school productions, gained professional and career insights, and gave their all on and off stage for recognition in their respective area of theatre arts passion…with a lasting impression:

Ashley Cates ’27 (The Glass Menagerie), Aubrey Coons ’24 (Twelfth Night), and Alissa House ’25 (The Glass Menagerie) were nominated to audition for a prestigious Irene Ryan Acting Scholarship.

The Graceland acting ensemble received recognition for their work onBKLYN The Musical, portraying the central cast „The City Weeds“: Chyler Aiwohi, Conner Holben ’23, Lilly Meier, Riley Newendorp ’24, Daniel Orozco, Jared Richards, Angel Taylor ’26.

Clara Cleland-Leighton ’24 (Costume Design), Raelynn Clemann ’25 (Costume Design) and Justice Cunningham ’26 (Props) were recognized by the region for their artistic achievements. Along with guest lighting designer Kris Kirkwood, Clara Cleland-Leighton (Costume Design) was further recognized for their work onThe Glass Menagerie.

Returning to campus inspired, they are however not resting on their fame and already working on submissions for next year in the areas of writing, acting, and directing.

Cara Phipps, Assistant Professor of Theatre, applauds the creativity, energy and spirit the students displayed at the KCACTF. „It was a wonderful representation of Graceland Theatre,“ she says. „I am so proud of both the students’ performance and their engagement with the opportunities this nationally supported conference provides.“

„Last year was the first year after the pandemic that we were able to attend the festival in-person, and the experience the students had was life-changing,“ says Kimberly Manuel,Interim Department Chair for the Visual and Performing Arts. „It’s now a tradition that each January we take a group of theatre students to KCACTF for the entire week to celebrate what being a creative theatre person is all about.”
