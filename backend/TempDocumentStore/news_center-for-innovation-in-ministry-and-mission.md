TheCommunity of Christ Seminary at Graceland Universityis continuing to innovate what it means to be a seminary. In partnership with the sponsoring church, Community of Christ, the university is excited to announce a new educational venture calledThe Center for Innovation in Ministry and Mission(CIMM) launching this fall. The CIMM is focused on creating non-credit opportunities for adult theological education, ministerial training, and leadership development. These efforts seek to empower and inspire disciples and leaders to become passionate practitioners of the mission of Jesus Christ.

Stassi Cramm, PhD, member ofCommunity of ChristFirst Presidency and Trustee to Graceland said, “I’m excited about the partnership being forged between Community of Christ and the Seminary at Graceland University. The ability to develop ministry skills or prepare for ordination online is an exceptional formation experience that brings together top-notch Seminary instructors and learners of various backgrounds.”

Earlier this year,Graceland hired David Lloydto lead efforts at the CIMM as part of its Seminary. Dean of the Community of Christ SeminaryZac Harmon-McLaughlin, DMin, chose Lloyd because of his extensive experience, including creating Developmetrics, which previously served as an online learning platform for Community of Christ ministers. CIMM will continue to expand on that mission this fall with two certificate programs: one in Ministry & Priesthood Ordination and the other in Christian Ministries. Both programs begin at the end of August and are accepting students now.

Dean Harmon-McLaughlin is excited about the new partnership. “The Center for Innovation in Ministry and Mission makes theological, ministerial, and leadership education accessible to everyone everywhere!” he said. “The seminary is dedicated to helping people discover the tools and resources necessary to change the world, and CIMM is one more way for us to do that.”

Registration details and more information can be found on theCenter for Innovation in Ministry and Mission site.
