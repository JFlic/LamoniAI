Graduates celebrating Commencement Spring 2019

Graceland University is excited to announce that the Spring 2020 Commencement ceremony originally scheduled for April 26 on the Lamoni, Iowa, campus has been rescheduled for the Sunday of homecoming weekend, Oct. 2-4, 2020. The original ceremony was canceled due to COVID-19 precautions.

In an email communication sent to students Thursday, President Patricia H. Draves said, “The hard work and accomplishments you have strived for over these past years here at Graceland deserve to be recognized. It is extremely important to all of us in your Graceland family that your memory of your time on “the Hill” be given proper closure with a ceremony that celebrates all that you have achieved.”

Graceland homecomings are very well-attended by alumni and friends, and Homecoming 2020 will mark the 125th year of the university, making the celebration even more of a commemorative occasion. President Draves continued in her email to students Thursday, “This unprecedented time deserves a unique and unprecedented celebration, and we can think of no better way to honor your accomplishments than by celebrating with you during the homecoming weekend that will mark Graceland’s 125th year of existence.”

Complete details are yet to fully be determined, but seniors set to walk this spring will have the choice to be recognized in a rescheduled commencement ceremony Sunday, Oct. 4. In order to provide the most flexibility, seniors may also choose to walk in the Fall 2020 (December) or Spring 2021 ceremony.
