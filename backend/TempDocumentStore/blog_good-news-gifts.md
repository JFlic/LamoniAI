These alumni and their stories, along with many others, are examples of how deep roots strengthen our community, enabling Graceland to grow and prosper. It is these roots that allow Graceland to grow, inspire new generations, and continue its mission of providing a transformative education in an environment that prepares students to live meaningful and productive lives. Their lasting contributions ensure that future students can build their own legacies, just as they have, in a community that cherishes its past and looks forward to its future.

Tee & Debbie NessTee ’75 and Deborah “Debbie” Hawthorne ’75 Ness, high school sweethearts whose relationship deepened at Graceland, continue to cherish the community that played a pivotal role in their early lives together.

Their recent generous donation aims to address Graceland’s greatest needs — from student support initiatives to substantial scholarships. Debbie fondly shares, “Graceland was where Tee and I embraced all the fun and fellowship of our houses, Cheville and Sariah. It’s where we enjoyed endless food and ice-cold milk at the Commons, and Indian Fry Bread at The Swarm Inn — it’s where our lives together truly began. It’s thrilling to know we can help others start their stories here.”

Their contribution reflects their profound belief in Graceland’s lasting values and the life skills it imparts, which they credit with launching them into life’s great adventures. “Graceland continues to foster the kind of values and decision-making skills that shaped us back then. This place is dear to our hearts, and we enthusiastically support its mission,” adds Debbie. The Ness’ gifts are a heartfelt tribute to a place that gave them so much, ensuring that current and future students can also experience the best of Graceland.

Greg & Jeanne MannGregory “Greg” ’70 and Jeanne Fisher ’72 Mann’s sense of gratitude toward Graceland University motivated them to establish the Greg and Jeanne Fisher Mann Family Endowed Scholarship. This scholarship allows students to access the transformative education that shaped their own lives, echoing the Manns’ experiences at Graceland. Committed to giving back, the Manns aim to extend the exceptional opportunities they received to future generations.

The establishment of this scholarship not only provides financial assistance but also fosters a legacy of opportunity. It reflects Greg and Jeanne’s deep appreciation for the University and their desire to support an environment where students thrive. More than just aiding in tuition, the scholarship helps students engage fully in campus life and academic pursuits, making their Graceland Experience richer.

Their commitment reinforces the values of community and educational excellence at Graceland, making a lasting impact on the university and its students. Through their generosity, the Manns ensure that Graceland remains a center for growth and learning, preparing students to make meaningful contributions to society. Their involvement is a testament to the enduring bonds formed by the Graceland community.

Jim & Cathy LysingerJames “Jim” ’86 and Catherine “Cathy” Wolfe ’88 Lysinger’s connection to Graceland University is exemplary, multifaceted, and extends through several generations. As vital members of the community — Jim on the board of trustees and Cathy as the secretary of the alumni board — their commitment is a powerful testament to their belief in Graceland’s mission and its impactful role in shaping students’ futures. They contribute significantly, not just with their leadership but also through financial support for capital projects like the Newcom Center, the Morden Center and the Henson Strength and Conditioning Center, enhancing the University’s facilities and programs.

Their generous donations help ensure that Graceland continues to be a place where students can excel academically, athletically, and personally. Their belief that the Graceland experience sets the foundation for a successful career fuels their involvement in strategic planning and decision-making, leading toward sustainable growth and educational excellence.

Their efforts help sustain Graceland’s legacy of developing leaders and changemakers, making a lasting impact not just on campus but across all communities. The profound engagement of the Lysingers showcases the critical role alumni play in advancing the values and aspirations of Graceland.
