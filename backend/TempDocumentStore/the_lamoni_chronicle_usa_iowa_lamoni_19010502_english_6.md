That  shows t h a t   you  have  taken  Solomon's  ant  hill for  an  object  lesson.

The  fragThe most  of  Solomon's  writings  have perished.  They  have  gone  out  of exist­ ence  as  thoroughly  as  tho  20  books  of Pliny  and  m ost  of  the  books  of  Aes­ chylus  and Euripides  and  Yarro  and  1 m ent  of  seed  it  hauls  Into  Its  habltaQulntillan. Solomon's  Song  and  Ec-  ! tion  may  be  so  small  that  the  unaided clesiajfi's  and  Proverbs,  pieserved  by  1  eye  cannot  see  it,  but  the  insectile insplrlliLon. are  a  small  part  ot  his  , work goes  on,  tlie  carpenter  aut  at volunM ous  productions. 1-Ie was  a  j work above ground, the mag r e a t ^ I e n t l s t .

Twenty specks  of  the  food  they are  moving  toward  their  granary  put upon  a  balance  would  hardly  make the  scales  quiver. All  of  it  work  on a  sm all  scale. There  is  no  use  In  our refusing  a  mission  because  it  Is  insig­ nificant. Anything  that  God  in  his providence  puts  before  us  to  do  is important. The  needle  has  its  ofllce as  certainly  as  the  telescope  and  the spade as a parliam entarian scroll.  You know  what  became  of  tin  man  in  the parable  of  the  talents  who  burled  the one  talent instead  of  putting  it  to  prac­ tical  and  accumulative  use. His  apol­ ogy  was  of  no  avail. i r   t r e e   t h a t   is  in  Lebanon  even e  hyssop  that  springeth  out  of 11; he  spake  also  of  beasts  and 1 and  of  creeping  things  and  of ' Besides  all these scientific he  composed  3,000 proverbs ,005  songs,

There  is no  need  of  our  w asting  time and  energy  in  longing  for  some  other sphere. There  are  plenty  of  people  to do  the  big  and  resounding  work  of  the church  and  the  world. No lack of brigadier  generals  or  m aster  builders or  engineers  for  bridging  Niagaras  or tunneling  Rocky  mountains.  For  every big  enterprise  of  the  world  a  dozen candidates. What  we  want  is  private soldiers  in  the  common  ranks,  masons not  ashamed  to  wield  a  trowel,  candi­ dates  for  ordinary  work  to  be  dono  in ordinary  ways in ordinary places Right  whore  we  are  there  is  something th a t  God  would  have  us  do. Let  us ' o t   A l t o ^ e t l i o r   C o m m e n d a b le do  it,  though  it  may  seem  to  be  as and  march  in  straight  line  j  unim portant  as  the  rolling  of  a  grain of  corn  h)to  an  ,m t  um

As  large  ant  hills  as  liavo ever  been  constructed  will be con­ structed  again Put  your  tru st  in  God and  do  your  duty,  and  your  best  days are  yet  to  come.

## Im parts  U seful  Lessons.

I Furthermore,  go  to  the  an t  and  conI  s id e r  th a t  if  God  honors  an  insect  by I  m alting  it  our  instructor  in  im portant j lessons  we  ought  not  to  abuse  the lower  orders  of  creation It  has  been found  by  scientists  that  insects  transi fixed  in  the  case  of  a  museum  have i been  alive  and  in  torture  for  years, j j ow   niuch the  insect  and  th e  fowl  and the  brute  may  be  rightly  called  to  suf­ fer  for  the  advancement  of human knowledge  and  the  betterm ent  of  the condition  of  the  human  race  I  do  not now  stop  to  discuss,  but  he  who  use­ lessly  harms  any  of  God's  living  crea­ tion  insults  the  Creator Alas,  for  the horrors  of  vivisection! I  have  no  con­ fidence  in  the  m orality  of  a  man  or woman  who  would  harm  a  horse  or dog  or  a  cat  or  a  pigeon. Such  men and women,  under  affront,  if tney dared  would take  the  life  of  a  human being You cannot  make  me  believe th a t  God  looks  down  indifferently  upon the galled  neck  of  the  ox  or  the  cruelly  curbed  bit  of  the  horse or the  un­ , w i  sheltered  cattle  in  the  snowstorm  or .. , . . . . the  cockpit  or  the  bear  baiting  or the  pigeon  shooting  or  the  laceration of  fish  that  are  not  used. Go  to  the ant,  thou  m iscreant,  and  see  how  God honors  it. In  the  great  college  of  the universe  It  has  been  appointed  your professor. All  over  the  land  and  all over  the  world  there  are  over-driven horses  that  ought  to  be  unharnessed, caged  birds  th a t  ought  to  be  put  on th e ir   wings  in  th e   free  a ir  of  heaven, droves  of  cattle  agonized  of  thirst  on the  freight  trains  where  they  ought to  be  watered  and crustacea being broiled  alive  th a t  ought  to  be  lifted out  of  the  fire. Christ  chose  twelve apostles  for  the  human  race  in  tho first  century,  and you know their names,  hut  In  the-  nineteenth  century rW   ,chose  his  th irteen th   apostle;\ who

Furthermore,  go to the ant an6 learn  the  lesson  of  God  appointed  or­ der. The  being  who  taught  the  insect how  to  build  was  geometer  as  well  as architect. The  paths  inside  that  lit­ tle  home  radiate  from   the  door  with as  complete  arrangem ent  as  ever  the boulevards  of  a  city  radiated  from  a trium phal  arch  or  a  flowered  circle. And  when  they  m arch  they  keep  per­ fect  order,  moving  in  straight  lines, turning  out  for  nothing. If  a  tim ber lie  in  the  way.  they  climb  over  It. If there  be  a  house  o r  barn  In  the  way, they  march  through  It. Order  in  ar­ chitectural  structure,  order  In gov­ ernment,  order  of  movement,  order  of expedition. So  let  us  all  observe  this God  appointed  rule  and  take  satis­ faction  in  the  fact  that  things  are not  at  loose  ends  in  this  world. If there  is a  divine  regulation  In  a  colony or  republic  of  Insects,  Is  there  not  a divine  regulation  in  the  lives  of  im­ mortal  men  and  women?  If  God  cares for the  least of  his  creatures and shows them  how  to  provide  their  meat  in  the summer  and  gather  their  food  in  the harvest,  will  he  n ot  be  interested  in matters  of  human  livelihood  and  In the  guidance of human  affairs? I preach  the doctrine  of  a  particular providence. 'Are  not  two  sparrows sold  for  a  farthing,  and  yet  not  one of  them  is  forgotten  before  God? Are ye  not  of  more  value  than  many  spar­ rows'' Let  there  be  order  In  our  in­ dividual  lives,  order  In  the  family,  or­ der  in  the  church,  order  in  the  state.

## God's  Care  o f  S m a ll  Thlnga.

After  w hat  Linnaeus and Pierre Huber  have  told  us  concerning  these living  m ites  of  th e  natural  world,  are we  not  ready  to  believe  that  the  God who  turns  the  wheel  of  the  solar  sys­ tem and the vaster wheel of the  universe  regulates  the  beehive  and the  ant  hill  and  th a t  all  the  affairs  of our mortal  lives are  under divine  man­ agement? When  some  one  asked  a hermit  on  the  top  of  a  mountain  in Italy  if  he  did  not  feel  it  dangerous to  live  so  m any  m iles  from human habitation,  he  replied; 'No. Provi­ dence  is  my  very  n ex t  door  neighbor.'

He  who  became  Sir  Thomas Gres­ ham  and  built  the  Royal  Exchange  in London when an  infant was abandoned b> his  mother  in  tbe  fields. Did  i' just  happen  so  th a t  the  chirping  of  a grasshopper  brought  a  boy  to  the spot where  the  babe  lay  and  his  life  was saved'' Not  so,  thought  Sir  Thomas Gresham,  who,  having  arrived  at  great wealth  and  power,  chose  a  grasshop­ per for his crest and had the figure of a grasshopper  imlucsscd on the wall of the  Royal Ex< hange and  had  a t the  top  a weather \a n e in the  figure  of  a  grasshopper. The  Waldensian  Christians  in  the sev­ enteenth  century  were  expelled  from tho  \alleys,  aud  on  their  way  800  of them  were  starving  to  death. Did  it ju st  happen  so  th a t  one  night  the  deep snow  suddenly  thawed  and  showed  a large  am ount  of  w heat  which  had  been covered  by  the  untim ely  snow  and  was suddenly  uncovered  so  that  the  hun­ ger was satisfied  and  the  S00  lives  were saved9 Did  it  ju s t  happen  so? Near Port  Royal,  Jam aica,  is  a  tomb  with this  inscription: ' Here  lieth  the  body of  Louis  Caldy,  Esq  ,  a  native  of  Mont­ pellier,  in  France,  which  country  he left  on  account  of  th e  revocations. 1-Ie was  swallowed  up  by  the  earthquake, which  occurred  a t  this  place  in  1G92, but,  by  the  great  providence  of  God. was  by  a  second  shock  liung  Into  the sea,  w here  he  continued  swimming  till rescued  by  a  boat  and  lived  forty  years afterw ard' Was  the  release  of  that man  from  the  jaw s  of  the  earthquake a  'ju st  happen  so?'

We  live  in  tim es  when  there  are  so many  clashlngs. There  seems  almost universal  unrest. Large  fortunes swal­ low  up  small  fortunes. Civilized  na­ tions  trying  to  gobble  up  barbaric  na­ tions. Upheaval  of  creeds  and  people who  once  believed  everything  now  be­ lieving  nothing The  old  book  that Moses  began  and  St.  John  ended  bom­ barded  from  scientific observatories and  college  classrooms. Amid  all  this disturbance and uncertainty that which  many  good  people  need  Is  not  a stimulus,  but a  sedative,  and  in  my text I  find  it-divine  observation  and  guid ance  of  m inutest  affairs. And  nothing is  to  God  large  or  sm all-planet  or  ant hill-the  God  who  easily made the worlds  employing  his  infinity  in  the wondrous  construction  of  a  spider's foot.

Before  we  leave  this  subject  let  us (hank  God  for  those  who  were  willing to  endure  the  fatigues  and  self-sacri­ fices  necessary  to  m ake  revelation  of the  natural  world,  so  re-enforcing  the Scriptures. If the  microscope  could speak,  w hat  a  story  it  could  tell  of hardship  and poverty and suffering and perseverance  on  the  part  of  those  who employed  it  for  im portant  discovery' It  would  tell  of  th e   blinded  eyes  of  M Strauss,  of  the  H ubers  and  of  scores of  those  who,  after inspecting the minute  objects  of  God's  creation,  stag­ gered  out  from  th eir cabinets with vision  destroyed. This  hour  In  many a  professor's  study  the  work  of  put­ ting  eyesight  on  the  altar  of  science is  going  on. And  what  greater  loss can  one  suffer  thaD  tho  loss  of  eye­ sight,  unless  it  be  loss of reason? While the  telescope  is  -reaching  farther up  and  the  m icroscope  is  reaching far­ ther  down, both are exclaiming: 'There  iB  a  God,  and  he  is  infinitely wise  and  infinitely ; good! Worship him,  and  w orship  him   forever! '

All manner of extravagant expressions are possible when a woman's norvos are overwrought.

The spasm at the top of the wind pipe or bronchial tubes, ' ball  rising  in  the  throat,'  violent  beating  of  the  heart, laughing  and  crying  by  turns, muscular  spasms  (throwing the arms about), frightened by the most  insignificant  occur­ rences-are all  symptoms  of  a  hysterical  condition  and  se­ rious derangement of  the female organs.

Any  female  complaint  may  produce  hysterics,  which must be regarded as  a  symptom  only. The cause, however, yields quicHy to L y d ia   E .

## MAM-M-M A 11 DONT YOU  HEAR BABY  CRY?

Do  you  forget  that  summer's  coming with all  its  dangers  to  the  little  ones-all  troubles bred  in the bowels.

The  summer's  heat  kills  babies  and  little children  because  their  little  insides  are  not  in good,  clean,  strong condition.

Winter  has  filled  the  system  with  bile. Belching,  vomiting  up  of  sour  food,  rash, flushed  skin,  colic,  restlessness,  diarrhoea  or constipation,  all testify that  the  bowels  are  out of order.

If you want the little ones to face  the coming  dangers with­ out anxious  fear  for  their  lives,  see  that  the  baby's  bowels  ate gently, soothingly, but  positively cleaned oat  in  the  spring  time, nnd made  strong and healthy  before  hot weather sets  in.

The only safe laxative  for  children, pleasant  to  take  (they ask  for  more) is  CA.SCARETS. Nursing mothers  make  their milk  mildly  purgative  for  the  baby  by  eating  a CASCARET now  and  then. Mama  eats  a CASCARETbaby gets  the

benefit. guarantee, Trv  it! Send  for  a  10c  box  of CASCARETS to-day  and  you  will  find  that,  as  we all irregularities of the little and big childrens insides are
