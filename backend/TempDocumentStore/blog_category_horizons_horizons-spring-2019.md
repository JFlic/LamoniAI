With funding for Newcom Student Union nearing completion, we are excited to turn our attention to Graceland’s architectural icon: CLOSSON PHYSICAL EDUCATION CENTER.

2018 was a big year for Women’s Volleyball Head Coach STEW McDOLE ’65 — the latest of many, many big years in his 37 seasons coaching the Yellowjackets — and his accomplishments and accolades shine a light on the impact he has had on the volleyball world.

Jonathan Montalvo moved to Indiana from Lares, Puerto Rico, when he was 15 years old. He completed high school there before attending Purdue University and then going on to get his master’s degree in Spanish literature from Western Michigan University and his PhD in Hispanic cultural studies from Michigan State University.

ZAC HARMON-MCLAUGHLIN, MA, ’08, joined Graceland’s staff as the director of the Community of Christ Seminary in March 2019.

In November 2018, Graceland hired DAVID SIDDALL ’85 as the Vice President for Business and Finance.

As you read in the previous issue of Horizons, construction will begin this spring on the renovation and expansion of the Memorial Student Center (MSC) as it is transformed into Newcom Student Union.

Graceland celebrates the 50th anniversary of the School of Nursing in this issue of Horizons. It is a great example of how many different people and their accomplishments have made us what we are today. What an impressive record!
