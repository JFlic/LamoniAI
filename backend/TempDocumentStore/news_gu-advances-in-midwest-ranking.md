Graceland is continuing to climb up the ladder in the U.S. News & World Report’s America’s ‘Best Colleges’ rankings. In the recently released 2013 rankings, Graceland advanced three levels to the #88 position. This accomplishment marks Graceland’s third year in a row ranking as a ‘first tier’ Midwest Region of Private University. The standing not only provides Graceland national recognition, but is a testament to the university’s progress as it continues to improve the quality of its academic programs.

Just last year, Graceland increased its ranking 16 levels. Over the course of two years, the university has increased its ranking nearly 20 positions. Highlights from the Report’s standings include mention of Graceland’s small class sizes, with 72 percent of classes containing 20 or fewer students; our financial aid services, with 70 percent of undergraduate students receiving need-based financial aid; and the average need-based scholarship or grant coming at $15,020; our admissions process, which the ranking dubbed “selective”; and our unique 4-1-4 academic calendar, that provides students opportunities to participate in Graceland’s unique ‘Winter Terms’.

The rankings also noted Graceland’s student services, including everything from non-remedial tutoring to health services to safety precautions. Maintaining a 15:1 student to faculty ratio augments the Report’s rankings as an important way for prospective students and parents to not only discover Graceland, but to compare it with other esteemed universities.

“This ranking shows that Graceland offers excellent academic programs that can compete with anyone,” said Graceland President Dr. John Sellars. “This really validates the progress we’ve made over the last few years and our continued appearance on the Report’s list is giving us an excellent reputation.”

Schools in four regions were ranked as first or second tier schools by U.S. News & World Report, an annual benchmark of colleges and universities that provide high school students and their parents an excellent starting point in their college search. The rankings reveal quality institutions, ranked by widely accepted indicators like retention, graduation rates, quality of faculty, and the “feel” of campus life.

“Graceland’s movement up the first-tier rankings on the most recent U.S. News & World Report’s list comes as no surprise to me. This only verifies how the university’s renewed commitment to academic excellence is beginning to bear even more and better fruit,” said Parris Watts, Graceland VP for Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty.

The rankings noted that Graceland’s most popular majors include Education, Health Professions and related programs, and Business, Management, Marketing and related services. The Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education and the Graceland School of Nursing were also recently recognized by TheBestSchools.org, an independent Web site that provides in-depth rankings of college and degree programs. With top-rankings and recognition from a variety of sources, Graceland is developing a strong reputation for academic excellence and establishing itself as one of the best choices available for students of the future.

“Graceland’s ranking with U.S. News in addition the online teacher education program being ranked 8th in the nation by TheBestSchools.Org is indicative of the measures the Gleazer School of Education has taken to become known as the best teacher preparation center in the Midwest. Keeping on the cutting edge and delivering rigorous and meaningful programs to students increases the opportunity for continued national recognition,” said Tammy Everett, Dean of the Graceland School of Education.

Graceland University was established in 1895 as a non-sectarian liberal arts institution of higher learning. It operates campuses in Lamoni, Iowa and Independence, Missouri, and offers degree completion programs at three other sites: the Kirkwood Community College campus in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; the Indian Hills Community College campus in Centerville, Iowa; and the North Central Missouri College campus in Trenton, Missouri.

Students from 40 states and 40 nations choose from more than 50 academic majors and programs at Graceland.
