Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/academics/academic-catalogs/graduate-catalog-home/graduate-academic-policies-procedures/#top

Academic integrity is a highly valued principle that undergirds all facets of academic life at Graceland University. Adherence to principles of honesty is a requisite for preparing students as competent responsible persons. Students admitted to the university are expected to uphold standards of academic integrity, i.e. the avoidance of fraud, plagiarism and cheating in any form.

All employees are to comply with and enforce this policy, any questions and concerns should be directed to Academic Affairs. An instructor may assign a grade of “F” for the course in cases of fraud, plagiarism and/or cheating. When an “F” grade is assigned, the student may not drop the course. All cases of fraud, plagiarism and/or cheating will be reported to the respective dean or department chair, Program Director and the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Dean of Faculty (VPAA). The VPAA may impose additional consequences including sanctions or dismissal from a program or from Graceland University. The student may appeal the imposition of sanctions by the VPAA to the President.

A student may appeal either of the following:

Students are responsible for meeting the standards of academic performance established for each course in which they are enrolled. The establishment of the criteria for grades and the evaluation of student academic performance are responsibilities of the course faculty. Grade appeal is available only for the review of allegedly capricious grading and not for review of the faculty’s evaluation of the student’s academic performance.

An appeal is initiated by submitting a typed statement to the Chair of the appropriate graduate committee, no later thanseven (7) working daysafter documentation of the failing final course grade or recommendation for dismissal.

The typed appeal statement submitted by the student must include the following:

Within the graduate programs, student requests for exceptions to academic policies are reviewed and acted upon by the appropriate committees within the school. Decisions by the school committee are final. Examples of issues appropriate for student petitions for exception to academic policy may include, but are not limited to:

Students should contact their Program Consultant for assistance with filing a petition for exception to academic policy.

Once accepted into a graduate program, students will be assigned a Program Consultant who will develop a program completion plan. No later than one month prior to each trimester, students are responsible for contacting their Program Consultant about registration.

Any changes to the program completion plan must be discussed with the Program Consultant. Students may add a course during the first 13% of the session with the instructor’s consent and may withdraw without penalty from a course during the first 60% of the session. Graceland University students may withdraw from a course through the 13% point of the session without a “W”. A grade of “W” is recorded in any course from which the student withdraws after 13% and through 60% of the session. After 60% of the session is complete, the student is not allowed to withdraw from the course, and will be awarded the appropriate grade in the course.

Students not participating in an online course before the census date (last day to add/drop a course) may be administratively withdrawn with or without penalty.

Students not returning to Graceland for the next semester or term are required to officially initiate the withdrawal process. Graduate students must formally notify their Program Consultant of the intent to withdraw and initiate the withdrawal process.

When a student is accepted into a graduate program, they are automatically scheduled for courses in the program. In order to avoid additional fees related to dropping registered courses, students must inform their Program Consultant in writing of their intention to withdraw prior to the start date of the term.

A student who is registered and pursuing classes at Graceland University may elect to Stop Out for one trimester without being officially withdrawn from the University, unless he/she plans to attend another institution during a trimester (fall, spring, or summer), or he/she is leaving Graceland University for medical reasons. A student who stops out during a trimester is eligible for a stop out through the next trimester. For documented military, official church mission, and foreign aid service reasons, a student may stop out for a period greater than one trimester. Students may convey to their Program Consultant in person, writing, or by telephone that he/she wishes to stop out for a trimester.

Courses for which the student is registered in future terms will remain in the system. The student’s financial aid packaging methodology will remain the same. The student will otherwise not be considered withdrawn. The student will be reported to the U.S. Department of Education as Not Enrolled during the term of the Stop Out. A student enrolled in a locked-in tuition program or cohort model may have additional continuous enrollment obligations. An international student will not maintain his/her immigration status if he/she chooses to stop out.

If the student begins the Stop Out during the trimester, the following conditions also apply. Charges will be pro-rated following the standard refund policy which may result in a balance due. Financial Aid Services will calculate the Return of Title IV funds. Graceland loan offices will advise the student of the amount he/she has borrowed and his/her responsibility to repay the loans. Any grace period for a loan will go into effect and could be exhausted before the student returns. Current courses for which the student is enrolled will be recorded as follows: when the Stop Out is effective before the last day to drop classes for the session, classes will be dropped from the student’s record; after the last day to drop classes, but before the last day to withdraw from classes, “W” grades will be recorded; and after the last day to withdraw from classes, the appropriate grade will be recorded.

Students who are called into active military duty, and the spouse of service members with a dependent child(ren) who are called into active military duty, including the National Guard and Reserve active duty, during the course of an academic term may receive refunds and course credits.

Non-degree seeking students interested in graduate and/or continuing education courses may inquire with Program Consultants regarding availability of classes. Students may request a Visiting Student Application form. Fees and rates vary depending on program.

At least twelve months prior to the fall or spring commencement convocations, students wishing to participate in the ceremony must complete and submit anApplication for Graduation. Submitting an application will activate a series of communications that will keep applicants informed about possible graduation discrepancies needing to be resolved, ordering caps and gowns, and the schedule of commencement activities. A graduation fee is assessed after receipt of the application.

It is the responsibility of the student to apply for graduation preferably one year prior to the anticipated graduation date, but not later than 30 days prior to the graduation ceremony.

Two commencement ceremonies are available each academic year.

In accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, academic information about a student is not released unless written authorization is given by the student. However, the university may use its discretion to release directory information unless the student specifically requests otherwise. The following is designated as directory information: name, local and home address, local and home telephone number, email address, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards earned, most recent previous school attended, and photograph.

The complete policy on Privacy, Disclosure, and Access to Student Records is available below.

SUBJECT:  Privacy, Disclosure and Access to Student Records.

PURPOSE:   To comply with the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and to delineate Graceland University’s (Graceland) policy for disclosure of, and access to, educational records.

DEFINITIONS:

Directory Information:  Graceland designates the following as directory information: name, local and home address, local and home telephone number, e-mail address, date and place of birth, major field of study, class level, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards earned, most recent previous school attended, and photograph. Graceland may disclose any of the above directory information without prior consent, unless notified in writing by the student to the contrary prior to the start of classes each period of enrollment. Such writing should be delivered to the Office of Residence Life.

Education records:  any record (in handwriting, print, film, tapes, video, or other medium) maintained by Graceland or an agent of Graceland, which is directly related to a student, except the following:

Graceland Official: A person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, support staff or student worker position; person elected to the Board of Trustees; a person employed by or retained by Graceland to perform a special task, such as an attorney or auditor; employees or students appointed to official Graceland committees.

Designated Records Custodians: The following positions are the designated record custodians and only those custodians should release the types of data listed in the first column:

In accordance with Section 99.7 of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations to provide annual notification of students’ FERPA rights, Graceland University includes such notification in the student handbook.

Student’s inspection of education records: Students may inspect and review their education records upon request to the appropriate record custodian. Students may be required to complete a written request identifying as precisely as possible the record or records he or she wishes to inspect. The record custodian will make the needed arrangements for access as promptly as possible and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. Graceland will provide the copy as expeditiously as possible, but no later than 45 days from the receipt of the request. When a record contains information about more than one student, the student may inspect and review only the records which relate to him/her. If multiple students are referenced within a record, the record custodian will redact names and any identifying phrases.

Right of refusal to inspect records: Graceland reserves the right to refuse to permit a student to inspect the following records:

Right to deny transcripts and copies of records:  Graceland reserves the right to deny transcripts or copies of records not required to be made available by the FERPA in any of the following situations:

Fee for copies: The standard fee for copies will apply for any records made available in accordance with this policy.

Directory information may be disclosed without prior consent of the student unless Graceland is notified in writing to the contrary prior to the start of classes.

Graceland will disclose information from a student’s educational records only with written consent of the student, except the following:

Record of requests for disclosure:  Graceland will maintain a record of all requests for and/or disclosure of non-directory information from a student’s education records, other than a Graceland official with a legitimate educational interest. The record will indicate the name of the party making the request, any additional party to whom it may be redisclosed, and the legitimate interest the party had in requesting or obtaining the information. The record may be reviewed by the student, and/or parents of the student if the parents claim the student as a dependent for income tax purposes.

Student’s right to request correction of records: Students have the right to request corrections of records they believe are inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of their privacy rights. Following are the procedures for the correction of records:

A student’s request to amend a record must be directed to the designated record custodian (see the record custodian listing above). The student must identify the part of the record to be changed and specify why the information is inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student’s privacy or other rights. If the record custodian agrees with the request, the record will be changed.

If the record custodian believes that the information presented does not merit a change, the student will be notified of that decision and advised of the hearing process. If a hearing is requested the following steps will be followed:

PROCEDURE:In accordance with FERPA, academic information about a student will not be released unless written authorization is given by the student. However, Graceland officials may use discretion to release directory information (defined above) unless the student specifically requests otherwise following the process set forth above.

Approved: January 23, 2019

In order to be eligible to receive Title IV federal aid, a student must be making satisfactory academic progress. Please note that satisfactory academic progress may be different from certain standards set by the school for your specific program.

The Graceland University Graduate Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards for financial aid apply to all graduate students who want to establish or maintain financial aid eligibility. The standards apply to the student’s entire academic record during their time enrolled in the graduate program whether or not the student received financial aid for previous terms of enrollment.

To qualify for financial aid, graduate students must progress according to the following standards. All financial aid recipients will be evaluated by two measurements: quantitative and qualitative. All graduate students must meet or exceed the minimum requirements for both measurements in order to remain eligible for financial aid.

The academic progress of financial aid recipients will be evaluated at the end of each payment period (semester or trimester).

Attempted credits include the following: successfully completed courses, non-passing credits (including F’s, withdrawals, incompletes, and audit grades), repeated courses, and transfer credits. Transfer credits refer to all credits accepted towards the completion of the student’s program (for more information in regards to accepted transfer credits refer to the Transfer Student Policy).

If a student is not meeting the minimum requirements for Satisfactory Academic Progress, they will be notified by email from their Student Financial Services Advisor that they are not meeting SAP.

Developmental Studies (Remedial Coursework): Undergraduate students may receive financial aid for a maximum of 30 semester hours of developmental coursework as long as the courses are required as a result of placement testing, the student is in an eligible program of study, and SAP requirements continue to be met. Developmental Studies are figured in the total of completed and attempted hours as well as part of the student’s cumulative GPA.

Academic Forgiveness: In the event that a student has been granted Academic Forgiveness, this does not exclude their previous academic record when figure hours completed, hours earned, or cumulative GPA as it pertains to satisfactory academic progress.

Students in the Graduate Programs are not eligible for a Financial Aid Warning Period.

If a student is no longer eligible to receive financial aid and must appeal due to not meeting the satisfactory academic progress standards, the student will be notified by email from their Student Financial Services Advisor that they must complete a SAP Appeal and be approved in order to be granted a Financial Aid Probation period.

Appeals for Financial Aid Probation must be submitted in writing or by email to their Student Financial Services Advisor, no later than two weeks from receipt of the Advising Form.

The appeal must contain the following information:

A student may be placed on Financial Aid Probation if a SAP Appeal has been approved by Student Financial Services. Financial Aid Probation allows a student to receive financial aid for one payment period. A student can only receive financial aid for a subsequent payment period if that student is now making SAP. It is possible for a student to receive more than one Financial Aid Probation during their academic career as long as they are not consecutive with another Financial Aid Probation. Financial Aid Probation typically is only for one payment period. On a case-by-case basis, the student’s academic plan could be approved to extend longer in order for the student to regain SAP eligibility.

After a student’s SAP Appeal has been reviewed, the student will be contacted by the Student Financial Services Office Manager who will explain the outcome of their appeal. The Office Manager will explain if the student is being granted a Financial Aid Probation and/or what the student needs to do moving forward to meet the satisfactory academic progress standards.

The marks used at Graceland University to indicate grades and the grade points for each semester hour of credit are as follows:

A – 4 grade points. Thorough mastery of subject, and disposition and ability to apply it to complex and unfamiliar situations.

B – 3 grade points. Demonstrated competence in subject matter mastery and clearly above-average ability to handle familiar to somewhat complex problems in the field.

C – 2 grade points. Effective learning and the development of the skill necessary to handle the familiar and less complex problems in the field.

D – 1 grade point. Limited ability to see relationships and to make applications except as specifically directed. Lowest passing grade for admission to the next dependent course.

F – No grade points. Course must be repeated for admission to dependent course(s).

P – Pass, C or better.

I – Incomplete, no grade points. Minimum course requirements unfinished for reasons acceptable to the instructor. Incomplete grades must be initiated by the student. An “Incomplete Grade Contract”, signed by the student and the instructor, is required before an Incomplete can be recorded. Grade given at the discretion of the instructor at completion of the work.In-Progress, no grade points.

NR – Not Recorded, no grade points.

W or WD – Withdrawn from the course at a specified date.

A semester hour (s.h.) is the unit of measure used at Graceland University to signify the amount of work that is associated with successful completion of a course.

Awarding semester hour credit is based upon evidence of student achievement. Student performance is measured as it relates to the prescribed learning outcomes of the course.

Graceland University offers courses in a variety of instructional modalities, including:

Regardless of the length of term or the mode of instruction, it is expected that a student who is prepared for college-level work and reasonably motivated to succeed will spend a minimum of 37.5 hours per semester hour credit in course-related activity. This includes actual classroom instruction time, exams (preparing and taking exams), class preparation (e.g. reading and written assignments, project work, etc.), and other class-relevant activities (e.g. lab hours, field trips, etc.).

Traditional face-to-face classes are reasonably expected to meet in a face-to-face environment a minimum of 680 minutes per credit hour, e.g. for a three (3) semester hour course.

As described above, online classes will meet according to the model described herein, e.g.: spend a minimum of 37.5 hours per semester hour credit in course-related activity. This includes actual classroom instruction time, exams (preparing and taking exams), class preparation (e.g.: reading and written assignments, project work, etc.), and other class-relevant activities (e.g.: lab hours, field trips, etc.). Exceptions to this may be granted by the appropriate Academic Dean.

In order to demonstrate compliance with U.S. Department of Education regulations and standards established by the Higher Learning Commission, all Graceland University instructors will create a good faith estimate of the learning time associated with each course they teach.

Effective with the Spring 2012 terms, the estimates of learning time will be submitted to the Vice President of Institutional Effectiveness and published in a master syllabus to be maintained in the office of the appropriate Dean for all courses offered.

University policy allows a grade to be changed by the instructor if the instructor has a legitimate reason to change the grade. Reasons for changing a course grade include, but are not limited to, an error in determining the letter grade, an error in recording the letter grade, and evidence of violation of academic integrity. Instructors may not change a grade after it has been submitted to the Registrar by allowing the student to do additional work after the session has ended, unless the grade submitted was an incomplete.

Courses in which a student has earned a failing grade may be repeated for credit according to school policy. If a course is repeated, the last grade earned will be the one to compute the cumulative grade point average. If a course is repeated, the original grade remains on the student’s permanent record with an indication that the student has repeated the course.

Graceland University may offer graduate-level study in selected topics from various disciplines upon approval by the Graduate Council. Graduate-level topics courses are repeatable for credit when topics vary and may be offered for a maximum of 3 s.h. on a letter-graded basis.

A written request for a grade of incomplete (“I”) is initiated by the student at least two weeks prior to the course end date. Faculty may assign a grade of “I” in cases when students are unable to complete the work for a course due to reasons beyond their control, or in cases when the faculty deems an “I” the most appropriate grade to give. The grade of “I” should not be abused and should be used only in cases where the incomplete is unavoidable and legitimate. Students may be required to provide formal documentation to support an incomplete grade request.

An electronic “Incomplete Grade Contract” that includes the reason for the incomplete, work that must be completed to earn a final course grade and the required completion date is generated when an “I” is submitted as a course grade. The completion date must be no later than the last day of the next scheduled term. For example, an Incomplete Grade Contract for a course in the A session of a 16 week trimester will have a completion date of the last day of the B session in that same 16 week trimester, and a contract for a course scheduled during the Spring trimester will have a completion date of the last day of the Summer trimester. The “I” is a temporary grade and will be automatically converted to an “F” if the course has not been completed by the end of the next scheduled term. Extensions beyond one scheduled term are not allowed for graduate courses.

Grades are recorded and accessible throughout the trimester via the Gradebook within each course website. Final grades are submitted to the Registrar by faculty at the end of each term and are available to students via My Graceland.

Graceland University uses Brightspace as the platform for online and hybrid classes. The technical requirements for effective use of the Brightspace platform may be found at this link:https://community.brightspace.com/s/article/Brightspace-Platform-Requirements

No official statement of the record of any student will be released until all fees, dues, loans, fines, and tuition assessed by the university or any department have been settled. The Registrar’s Office will issue transcripts as soon as possible upon written request by the person whose record is to be sent. Transcripts should be requested at least two weeks in advance of the date required. Copies are furnished at a charge of ten dollars each.

Fraud is the act of deceit or misrepresentation. The following list describes ways to avoid the most common forms of fraud.Altering, falsifying or misrepresenting an academic document alter or falsify or misrepresent an academic document.Helping someone else alter, falsify or misrepresent an academic document.Communicating false information by any means: oral, written, electronic or nonverbal.Forging a signature.PLAGIARISM. Plagiarism is representing someone else’s work as your own. The following list describes ways to avoid the most common forms of plagiarism.Submit papers that consist substantially of your own work. Do not buy, borrow or use complete, or nearly complete, papers from any source, electronic or otherwise.Set off all direct quotations within quotation marks or within the text in a block quote form. To fail to indicate direct quotations by one of these two methods is to commit plagiarism even if the failure is accidental and even if you give the source of the quotation. In a speech you must also indicate the beginning, ending and source of all direct quotations to the audience.If you derive an idea from another source, cite the source unless the idea is common knowledge, that is, unless people familiar with the subject you are discussing are aware of the idea.Cite the source of paraphrased material and avoid excessive paraphrasing. Too much paraphrasing minimizes your contribution.Use the citation style required by your professor for attribution.Do not use your own work from previous papers or projects on a current paper or project without the express permission of your instructor.CHEATING.

- Graduate Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)In order to be eligible to receive Title IV federal aid, a student must be making satisfactory academic progress. Please note that satisfactory academic progress may be different from certain standards set by the school for your specific program.The Graceland University Graduate Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards for financial aid apply to all graduate students who want to establish or maintain financial aid eligibility. The standards apply to the student’s entire academic record during their time enrolled in the graduate program whether or not the student received financial aid for previous terms of enrollment.Eligibility and EvaluationTo qualify for financial aid, graduate students must progress according to the following standards. All financial aid recipients will be evaluated by two measurements: quantitative and qualitative. All graduate students must meet or exceed the minimum requirements for both measurements in order to remain eligible for financial aid.The quantitative measure is the pace in which it will take the student to complete their program. All graduate students must obtain a 75% pace of completion or higher. The pace of completion standard is determined by the scheduled length of completion for the graduate student’s program (this varies by program) divided by the maximum timeframe of 133% defined by Graceland University for all Graduate Students. The pace of completion is calculated for each student by taking total credits completed (successfully completed with passing grades) divided by the total credits attempted. (Please see the section below, Attempted Credits, for clarification of what credits are considered attempted). A student will become ineligible to receive financial aid once it becomes evident that the student is unable to complete the program requirements without exceeding the maximum timeframe rather than waiting until they have exceeded the maximum timeframe.The qualitative measurement is the cumulative GPA of the student during their enrollment at Graceland during their graduate program. Transferred credits will not be used in the calculation of cumulative GPA. All graduate students must receive a minimum GPA of 3.0 or higher at each evaluation. (For information on how GPA is figured, refer to System of Grading Policy.)The academic progress of financial aid recipients will be evaluated at the end of each payment period (semester or trimester).Attempted CreditsAttempted credits include the following: successfully completed courses, non-passing credits (including F’s, withdrawals, incompletes, and audit grades), repeated courses, and transfer credits. Transfer credits refer to all credits accepted towards the completion of the student’s program (for more information in regards to accepted transfer credits refer to the Transfer Student Policy).If a student is not meeting the minimum requirements for Satisfactory Academic Progress, they will be notified by email from their Student Financial Services Advisor that they are not meeting SAP.Developmental Studies (Remedial Coursework): Undergraduate students may receive financial aid for a maximum of 30 semester hours of developmental coursework as long as the courses are required as a result of placement testing, the student is in an eligible program of study, and SAP requirements continue to be met. Developmental Studies are figured in the total of completed and attempted hours as well as part of the student’s cumulative GPA.Academic Forgiveness: In the event that a student has been granted Academic Forgiveness, this does not exclude their previous academic record when figure hours completed, hours earned, or cumulative GPA as it pertains to satisfactory academic progress.Financial Aid Warning PeriodStudents in the Graduate Programs are not eligible for a Financial Aid Warning Period.Financial Aid AppealIf a student is no longer eligible to receive financial aid and must appeal due to not meeting the satisfactory academic progress standards, the student will be notified by email from their Student Financial Services Advisor that they must complete a SAP Appeal and be approved in order to be granted a Financial Aid Probation period.Appeals for Financial Aid Probation must be submitted in writing or by email to their Student Financial Services Advisor, no later than two weeks from receipt of the Advising Form.The appeal must contain the following information:A statement by the student that outlines the circumstances that the student believes contributed to their lack of academic progress.The steps that the student plans to make to remedy their current academic situation.An Advising Form will be emailed to the student. This form will outline the progress required to regain SAP eligibility. The student will sign and return this form.A student may be placed on Financial Aid Probation if a SAP Appeal has been approved by Student Financial Services. Financial Aid Probation allows a student to receive financial aid for one payment period. A student can only receive financial aid for a subsequent payment period if that student is now making SAP. It is possible for a student to receive more than one Financial Aid Probation during their academic career as long as they are not consecutive with another Financial Aid Probation. Financial Aid Probation typically is only for one payment period. On a case-by-case basis, the student’s academic plan could be approved to extend longer in order for the student to regain SAP eligibility.After a student’s SAP Appeal has been reviewed, the student will be contacted by the Student Financial Services Office Manager who will explain the outcome of their appeal. The Office Manager will explain if the student is being granted a Financial Aid Probation and/or what the student needs to do moving forward to meet the satisfactory academic progress standards.

- System of GradingThe marks used at Graceland University to indicate grades and the grade points for each semester hour of credit are as follows:A – 4 grade points. Thorough mastery of subject, and disposition and ability to apply it to complex and unfamiliar situations.B – 3 grade points. Demonstrated competence in subject matter mastery and clearly above-average ability to handle familiar to somewhat complex problems in the field.C – 2 grade points. Effective learning and the development of the skill necessary to handle the familiar and less complex problems in the field.D – 1 grade point. Limited ability to see relationships and to make applications except as specifically directed. Lowest passing grade for admission to the next dependent course.F – No grade points. Course must be repeated for admission to dependent course(s).P – Pass, C or better.I – Incomplete, no grade points. Minimum course requirements unfinished for reasons acceptable to the instructor. Incomplete grades must be initiated by the student. An “Incomplete Grade Contract”, signed by the student and the instructor, is required before an Incomplete can be recorded. Grade given at the discretion of the instructor at completion of the work.In-Progress, no grade points.NR – Not Recorded, no grade points.W or WD – Withdrawn from the course at a specified date.Credit Hour DefinitionA semester hour (s.h.) is the unit of measure used at Graceland University to signify the amount of work that is associated with successful completion of a course.Awarding semester hour credit is based upon evidence of student achievement. Student performance is measured as it relates to the prescribed learning outcomes of the course.Graceland University offers courses in a variety of instructional modalities, including:Face-to-face, blended, and online instruction3-week, 8-week, and 15-week termsRegardless of the length of term or the mode of instruction, it is expected that a student who is prepared for college-level work and reasonably motivated to succeed will spend a minimum of 37.5 hours per semester hour credit in course-related activity. This includes actual classroom instruction time, exams (preparing and taking exams), class preparation (e.g. reading and written assignments, project work, etc.), and other class-relevant activities (e.g. lab hours, field trips, etc.).Traditional face-to-face classes are reasonably expected to meet in a face-to-face environment a minimum of 680 minutes per credit hour, e.g. for a three (3) semester hour course.41 fifty-minute face to face sessions plus final exam time (semester-based class) or 28 seventy-five-minute face to face sessions plus final exam time (semester-based class).8 four-hour face to face sessions (8-week subsession in trimester), or 14 three-hour face to face sessions (3-week sessions)As described above, online classes will meet according to the model described herein, e.g.: spend a minimum of 37.5 hours per semester hour credit in course-related activity. This includes actual classroom instruction time, exams (preparing and taking exams), class preparation (e.g.: reading and written assignments, project work, etc.), and other class-relevant activities (e.g.: lab hours, field trips, etc.). Exceptions to this may be granted by the appropriate Academic Dean.In order to demonstrate compliance with U.S. Department of Education regulations and standards established by the Higher Learning Commission, all Graceland University instructors will create a good faith estimate of the learning time associated with each course they teach.Effective with the Spring 2012 terms, the estimates of learning time will be submitted to the Vice President of Institutional Effectiveness and published in a master syllabus to be maintained in the office of the appropriate Dean for all courses offered.Changing a Course GradeUniversity policy allows a grade to be changed by the instructor if the instructor has a legitimate reason to change the grade. Reasons for changing a course grade include, but are not limited to, an error in determining the letter grade, an error in recording the letter grade, and evidence of violation of academic integrity. Instructors may not change a grade after it has been submitted to the Registrar by allowing the student to do additional work after the session has ended, unless the grade submitted was an incomplete.Courses RepeatedCourses in which a student has earned a failing grade may be repeated for credit according to school policy. If a course is repeated, the last grade earned will be the one to compute the cumulative grade point average. If a course is repeated, the original grade remains on the student’s permanent record with an indication that the student has repeated the course.Graduate-Level Topics CoursesGraceland University may offer graduate-level study in selected topics from various disciplines upon approval by the Graduate Council. Graduate-level topics courses are repeatable for credit when topics vary and may be offered for a maximum of 3 s.h. on a letter-graded basis.Graduate Student Incomplete Grade PolicyA written request for a grade of incomplete (“I”) is initiated by the student at least two weeks prior to the course end date. Faculty may assign a grade of “I” in cases when students are unable to complete the work for a course due to reasons beyond their control, or in cases when the faculty deems an “I” the most appropriate grade to give. The grade of “I” should not be abused and should be used only in cases where the incomplete is unavoidable and legitimate. Students may be required to provide formal documentation to support an incomplete grade request.An electronic “Incomplete Grade Contract” that includes the reason for the incomplete, work that must be completed to earn a final course grade and the required completion date is generated when an “I” is submitted as a course grade. The completion date must be no later than the last day of the next scheduled term. For example, an Incomplete Grade Contract for a course in the A session of a 16 week trimester will have a completion date of the last day of the B session in that same 16 week trimester, and a contract for a course scheduled during the Spring trimester will have a completion date of the last day of the Summer trimester. The “I” is a temporary grade and will be automatically converted to an “F” if the course has not been completed by the end of the next scheduled term. Extensions beyond one scheduled term are not allowed for graduate courses.Grade ReportsGrades are recorded and accessible throughout the trimester via the Gradebook within each course website. Final grades are submitted to the Registrar by faculty at the end of each term and are available to students via My Graceland.
