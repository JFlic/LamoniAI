National Management Resources, an educational facilities management expert with 40 years of experience, begins management of facilities in January 2025.

December 5, 2024 | Shane Adams

Graceland University is proud to announce a new partnership with National Management Resources, a company with over 40 years of experience in educational facilities management. Effective January 2, 2025, this collaboration is designed to enhance campus services for students, faculty, and staff while maintaining Graceland’s deep commitment to the Lamoni community.

National, whose mission is “Take care of the customer, and all else will fall into place,” brings unmatched expertise in managing facilities for schools and universities across the country. Graceland is already familiar with National’s excellence through their provision of security services on campus. This expanded relationship will ensure that Graceland continues to provide a safe, efficient, and inspiring environment for students and staff.

“This partnership is about more than just managing facilities—it’s about providing the best possible environment for our students while ensuring the well-being of our staff and supporting our local community,” said Graceland President Joel Shrock.

Graceland’s dedication to being “strongly rooted and still growing” is at the heart of this decision, and this partnership ensures that our campus will continue to be a safe and thriving space for all who call it home.

For more information about this transition, please contact Shane Adams atsmadams@graceland.edu.
