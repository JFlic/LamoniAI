May 22, 2018

With an audience made up of friends, family and supporters, Graceland Enactus delivered their final competition presentation of the 2017-18 school year to a panel of judges who would ultimately decide their fate.

In a league of three other schools – Canisius College, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Utah Valley University – those judges placed Graceland in the number-four spot. This placement places Graceland University Enactus as one of the top 16 Enactus teams in the country, and their placement means a $1,500 award for the program.

“What an incredible run this team has had,” expressed Jared Doty, Director of the Graceland University Sandage Center for the Study of Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship. “The success they have accomplished and the work they have done is bigger than just Graceland Enactus. It is a consequence of a supportive university and community partnerships that don’t end here. Keep watching these students; there’s definitely more to come.”

The top-four teams to advance presented directly after the results were announced Tuesday, and the ultimate winner will be determined and announced later today.

This is not the end for Graceland Enactus – even this year. Their project work continues to be driven and developed by passionate students working throughout the summer, while other projects are self-sustaining and continue to impact communities and people around the globe.

“I am very grateful to have had this opportunity to represent Graceland University at Nationals this year,” shared Graceland Enactus presenter Alyssa Dockins ‘18. “We are so proud of the work we accomplished. Our success has been undeniable and I know that the team will build on what we have done this year and make it even bigger and better.”
