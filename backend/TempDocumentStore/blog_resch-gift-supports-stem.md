Resch’s gift provides $50,000 annually to help maintain and enhance the Resch Science and Technology Hall, as well as $200,000 annually funding scholarships and program support for Resch Scholars, a new elite science and technology scholarship program. The pledge is renewable after 10 years.

This gift continues Resch’s lifelong support of his alma mater. For several years, Resch has ensured that Graceland’s science students have access to technology and facilities on par with advanced schools, but the establishment of this program marks an expanded commitment to the sciences by providing resources to recruit top students to study at Graceland.

RESCH SCHOLARS PROGRAM With the creation of the Resch Scholars Program and in partnership with the Richard J. Resch Foundation, Graceland establishes a fund to recognize industrious students excelling in the sciences through their hard work. This program honors Resch’s legacy of success throughout his life from humble beginnings.

Graceland will award full tuition scholarships to the best and brightest in the areas of biology, chemistry, data science and analytics, computer science, and health & movement science. Numerous partial scholarships will be awarded to students with preference given to first-generation and underrepresented groups in the sciences. The establishment of this program will provide new funding to recruit top-notch science students to engage in the sciences in the state-of-the-art Resch Science and Technology Hall at Graceland’s campus in Lamoni, Iowa.

“Richard Resch’s support of Graceland over the years has advanced the University’s mission in ways that will be felt for generations to come,” said Graceland President Patricia H. Draves, PhD. “As a scientist myself, I am personally grateful to Richard and his foundation’s generosity, ensuring our students in the sciences have access to an unparalleled experience that sets them up to become transformational leaders and change-makers the world needs.”

“The Resch Scholars program provides amazing opportunities for high achieving science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) students to study in our impressive facilities with our exceptional faculty. We are excited to have this program help students interested in STEM attend Graceland where they can become highly competitive applicants for graduate school or a job in their field.”

– Mary Shawgo, PhD, Chair, Department of Natural and Physical Sciences– Melanie Mason, DAT, Chair, Department of Health and Movement Science– Jason Smith, PhD, Chair, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Data Science
