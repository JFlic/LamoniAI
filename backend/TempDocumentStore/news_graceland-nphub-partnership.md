New relationship will revolutionize clinical rotation placements for nurse practitioner students.

July 27, 2023 | Shane Adams

In a move set to redefine the clinical rotation experience for nurse practitioner students, Graceland University, a leader in nurse practitioner education, announced a strategic partnership with NPHub, a pioneering healthcare technology firm specializing in matching graduate nursing students with clinical rotation placements. This groundbreaking partnership aims to help over 500 students secure preceptors for their clinical nursing rotations every year, significantly increasing graduation rates and directly impacting the quality of healthcare in America.

Joel Shrock, PhD, Graceland Vice President for Academic Affairs, announced the new initiative, saying, “Finding practicum placements is the number one concern for nurse practitioner  students in graduate programs. We wanted to address this issue head-on, and this new partnership with NPHub does just that. It will give Graceland nursing students an advantage in finding preceptors in a wide variety of clinical settings.”

About NPHub

NPHub, led by CEO Krish Chopra, is an Atlanta-based firm established in 2017. The technology company specializes in pairing graduate nursing students with experienced preceptors for their clinical practicum placements. Through its innovative marketplace platform, NPHub considers the nature of the clinical rotation, students’ geographical preferences, and specific areas of interest. NPHub’s mission aligns with supporting nursing students in their educational journeys, allowing them to graduate on time and effectively contribute to the healthcare sector.

Krish Chopra, CEO of NPHub, commented, “We are thrilled to be partnering with Graceland University. Our mission is to save healthcare by empowering Nurse Practitioners to graduate on time and get into practice faster, and our partnership with Graceland extends this mission. Through our app, we are aiming to help over 500 Graceland students secure their placements each year, providing a streamlined path from graduate nursing programs right into their clinical rotations.”

Graceland University’s nurse practitioner program is one of the most respected in the country. Offering baccalaureate nursing degrees for over 50 years and advanced degrees since 1995, Graceland has a legacy of pioneering distance learning models, even before the proliferation of online degrees.

“This is an exciting development for our nurse practitioner program,” said Jolene Lynn, PhD, Dean of the School of Nursing. “Our relationship with NPHub will give our nurses access to clinical placements that are critical for their success. Nurse practitioners are in extremely high demand, and we are ensuring that our programs are designed to give working nurses the maximum flexibility to complete their educational work.”

About the NPHub App

The NPHub app allows nurse practitioner students to search and apply for clinical placements based on their location preferences and specialization areas. The app also provides mentorship and support to students throughout their clinical rotation period, ensuring they gain the necessary skills and experience to succeed in their careers.
