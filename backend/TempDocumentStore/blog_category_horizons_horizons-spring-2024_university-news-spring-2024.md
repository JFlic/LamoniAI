Scholars’ Showcase Edition

When classes are canceled for the day but it’s a struggle to choose between all the learning opportunities, that’s when you know it’s Graceland’s Scholars’ Showcase.

The $1 million gift from Kathy and Joel ’79 Ross expands Wallace B. Smith Scholarship for Community of Christ youth and funds future opportunities for church leaders.

Graceland University remains committed to supporting the mental health of our students, and continues to refine and enhance services, ensuring every student benefits from resources meeting their unique needs.

In early April, as the semester was winding down and just in time for Commencement festivities, both monument signs on the Lamoni campus were upgraded as part of the University’s ongoing brand initiative.

For over 25 years, the Community of Christ-affiliated Health Ministries Association has been closely aligned with Graceland University and the School of Nursing. Last year, the association decided to dissolve and yet still managed to leave a legacy for Graceland nurses into the future.

###### July 12, 2024

Supporting Graceland is about much more than just giving — it’s about honoring the memories made on “the Hill,” giving back to a place that fosters both academic and personal growth, and leaving a legacy that outlasts the present.
