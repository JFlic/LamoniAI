The Iowa Commission on Volunteer Service (ICVS) approved on Monday a new $15K state-funded RSVP (formerly the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program) grant to be based atGraceland Universityin Lamoni. The RSVP of Southern Iowa will serve Decatur and Ringgold counties.

“Adding this program to the roster of previous Iowa projects expands RSVP coverage to nearly half of the counties in Iowa,” stated Patti Fields, Chair of the Iowa Commission on Volunteer Service. “Expanding national service and volunteer opportunities across the state is really the heart of our mission.”

RSVP connects volunteers age 55 and over with service opportunities in their communities that match their skills and availability. From building houses to immunizing children, from enhancing the capacity of nonprofit organizations to improving literacy skills, RSVP volunteers put their unique talents to work to make a difference.

About the ICVS (or Volunteer Iowa)The Iowa Commission on Volunteer Service and its partner agencies work with organizations and individuals on three main fronts. The first is to help agencies develop quality programs that use service as a strategy to fulfill their missions and address Iowa’s greatest areas of need. The second is to help engage Iowans in their communities by promoting service and expanding the volunteer base. Finally, the third area of work is to connect individuals with appropriate service opportunities by building the volunteer infrastructure. More information is available atwww.volunteeriowa.org.

About the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS)The federal government directly administers the RSVP and AmeriCorps State, AmeriCorps NCCC, AmeriCorps VISTA, Senior Companion and Foster Grandparents programs that support an additional 1,400 National Service participants in Iowa. More information is available atwww.nationalservice.gov.
