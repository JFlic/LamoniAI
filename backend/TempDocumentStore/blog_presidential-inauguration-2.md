February 13, 2025 | Shane Adams ’99

Joel D. Shrock, PhD, joined the University in the summer of 2022 as the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty and was appointed President based on the recommendation from a committee that consisted of trustees, administrators, faculty, staff, and alumni, who each did extensive interviews with many members of the Graceland community.

Shrock chose Graceland originally because of its unique profile, its multiple campuses, and its mission.

Graceland has a unique spirit that captured my attention,” said Shrock. “The university’s diverse student body, commitment to innovation, and dedication to fostering a community where all students feel they belong made Graceland a clear choice for me back when I joined the University in 2022. I am excited to lead an institution so closely aligned with my values and aspirations for higher education.”

“When I first met him, he was so open to hearing my ideas, and we discussed inclusivity and bringing students together. Dr. Shrock just brings an incredible energy to the campus.”

When he wasannounced as president, Shrock quickly distinguished himself as perhaps one of the first University presidents to extol the virtues of punk rock in his acceptance of the job.

CURRENT POSITION19th President of Graceland University

Upon meeting him for the first time, punk rock probably wouldn’t be the first place you would expect to find common ground with him, but he is anything but predictable. Shrock stepped to the microphone in September looking every bit the part of a lifelong academic and Gilded Age historian – complete with a bow tie. Then, his acceptance speech celebrated the spirit of punk, saying, “It is a challenge to convention. It challenges the status quo.”

Shrock went on to describe how universities could learn from punk rock by challenging ideas, embracing dissatisfaction, dissent, and debate, not to be nihilistic or disruptive or intolerant, but instead to engage with people who disagree, to challenge ideas. “Our passions must not divide us,” he said. “A university is a place where differences of opinion are necessary and good. They must unify us.”

Those who have worked with Dr. Shrock during his time at Graceland as Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty regularly bring up the dissonance of his buttoned-up, academic demeanor with his love of bands like the Dead Kennedys, Bad Religion, and Green Day.

“The word that comes to mind when I think of Joel is contradiction,” said Community of Christ President-Prophet Designate Stassi Cramm, PhD, ’03, who served on Graceland’s Board of Trustees when Dr. Shrock was hired. “You have a historian who wears bow ties but loves punk rock – it’s a wonderful contradiction.”

Even though many might find his choice of music unapproachable, Shrock himself is anything but that. “He’s really supportive and values every conversation I’ve had with him,” said Sehwan Kim, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sport Management. “He takes time to listen and connect with me and those around him. He’s very approachable and easy to talk to.”

“The university’s diverse student body, commitment to innovation, and dedication to fostering a community where all students feel they belong made Graceland a clear choice for me… I am excited to lead an institution so closely aligned with my values and aspirations for higher education.”

PRESIDENT JOEL SHROCK, PhD

Graceland Student Government (GSG) President Ishbel Wilson ’25 uses a word to describe Dr. Shrock that very few people associate with punk rock. “I would describe Dr. Shrock’s personality as bubbly. Everything he does just has a different energy to it. He just seems so joyous and happy about everything he does.”

Shrock joined Graceland in the post-pandemic era after spending nearly 30 years at other institutions. He completed both his undergraduate and master’s studies in history at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., before completing his PhD in U.S. History at Miami University in Ohio. History always sparked his interest, and his main area of focus is the Gilded Age, the period in American history from the late 1870s to the late 1890s, between the Reconstruction and Progressive Eras. “I chose to study the Gilded Age because Modern America was born out of the era,” he said. “Mass consumerism emerged, which is a precondition for true popular culture.”

Shrock wrote a book about the era in 2004, published through Greenwood’sAmerican Popular Culture Through Historyseries. Publishing a book is an impressive accomplishment for anyone, but Shrock did it when he and his wife’s oldest son was four, and their twins were newborn preemies. “Writing my book during that period was easily one of the hardest things I did in my career.”

“I don’t remember a time when I was not interested in history,” Shrock said. “I was that kid. Walt Disney historical movies likeJohnny Tremaingot me interested as a kid. By the time I was in fifth grade, I was an avid reader of Civil War and World War II history. I loved the storytelling and how the past provided so many clues about how we are today. I loved knowing the details and the data.”

Shrock excelled throughout school and qualified for a good scholarship and entry into the Honors College at Ball State. He still remembers the only D he ever received — Third Grade Handwriting. “True story,” he laughs.

He continued to perform well throughout his studies and had several accomplishments throughout his early academic career. “I think my undergraduate honors thesis on the Vietnam Antiwar Movement is good and based on solid research,” Shrock said. That project led to the publishing of his first article with one of his professors. His dissertation went on to win the top award in his PhD program. In 2009, Shrock won a Malone Fellowship to study Middle Eastern history in Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

“I didn’t know I wanted a career in higher education until I was a senior in college,” Shrock said. “My professors [Dr. Richard Aquila and Dr. Tony Edmonds] convinced me to apply for a graduate assistant position in the History Department, and when I was selected, they really started talking to me about being a history professor. I’d never considered that as a career option. I grew up in a small town with no college. I knew no professors. The very idea of that as a job was weird to me.”

Dr. Mary Kupiec Cayton, noted to be profoundly influential in President Shrock’s pursuit of academia and becoming a university president, spoke about “The Skills That Matter” at the inauguration.

And yet, when you begin to discuss higher education, curriculum, or teaching with him, he lights up, and it is difficult to think he ever considered another career path. He was heavily influenced by mentors along the way, particularly the late Drew Cayton, PhD. Shrock said of Cayton, “I took two classes from him as an undergraduate and then he moved to Miami University where I went for my PhD. I worked for him as a Teaching Assistant. He was a brilliant lecturer, dynamic, funny, charismatic, compelling. When he lectured, students often just listened and forgot to take notes. He wrote brilliant books, helped to create the field of Midwestern history, published prolifically, and was more humble than most in our profession. He was kind, decent, and generous. I wanted to be him. My mannerisms in public speaking are a direct imitation of Dr. Cayton. He had the ability to simplify very complex concepts for any audience.”

After graduating with his doctorate from Miami, Shrock worked at several different universities before landing at Anderson University in Indiana. There, he taught for 17 years before being granted Emeriti status when he joined Graceland. He also got his first experience as an administrator, becoming an academic dean in 2014. “It was then that I first realized I wanted to be a president,” he said. “When I was involved in decision-making and planning, I began to realize that my instincts and training had prepared me to be a president. From there, it was a process of exposing myself to the training and learning I felt I needed to be successful.” One opportunity was winning one of 30 fellowship spots in the Council of Independent Colleges’ Senior Leadership Academy.

Shrock grew up surrounded by family and friends in Albion, Indiana, a rural town similar to Lamoni in the northeastern part of the state. His maternal grandparents lived five miles away on a farm where he learned to help in many different ways – from helping with their massive garden to clearing ditches with a chainsaw.

He recalls being given a lot of responsibility at a young age. “My grandparents gave us tasks, and we went about them largely unsupervised,” he said. “It taught me that hard, physical tasks are best accomplished slow and steady. It also taught me there is nothing romantic about repetitive physical labor. Much of it is just tough – slogging through. Farm work taught me that effort and hard work can do incredible things. I learned I could pick five acres of asparagus in four hours by myself. I realized early on that my work ethic and dedication to task completion was an advantage that translated well in higher education.”

His parents taught him many lessons throughout his life. Shrock’s father was superintendent of the local school district and taught him the importance of supporting the entrepreneurial spirit of young kids, always buying the various things they would sell on their rounds trying to raise funds. Shrock took his father’s advice to heart: “If we don’t support our community, who will? What [my father] did was not about buying wrapping paper, candles, or cookie dough, it was about supporting those kids, their families, our schools, and our community,” Shrock recalled in his inauguration speech.

Shrock’s mother taught him the value of empathy and diversity through lessons learned during the civil rights era. “When my mother was in design school in the early 1960’s, her roommate was African American, and as a historian, I know this was the height of a contentious period of the Civil Rights Movement – sit-ins, Freedom Rides, beatings,” Shrock recalled during his inauguration speech. “My mother helped show me how people can transcend the currents of history if they embrace openness, empathy, and kindness.”

James “Kimo” Shrock introduced his brother, Dr. Joel Shrock, at the inauguration ceremony.

He grew up with three siblings: an older brother, Jason, a younger brother, James, and his sister, Judy. Together, they learned a great deal of lessons growing up on the farm in Albion, especially from their maternal grandparents. “We have a tendency in my family to dig into a job and not stop until it is done, no matter how long or how hard,” Shrock described. “Kelly has termed this ‘Shrocking it.’”

“SHROCKING IT”To work on a task diligently until it is done, regardless of the length of the task.

The Shrock siblings learned many other lessons during their time growing up:

• Life is not fair. Get over it. Sometimes one kid gets something and the other doesn’t.• Get to your dessert quickly. If cookies run out, too bad.• There is no such thing as ‘me time’ but you can usually avoid being bothered by reading a book.• Compromise is not a virtue but a necessity, especially in a large family when fighting over the TV.

“Family is a vital support network,” Shrock said. His inauguration ceremony was a marked example of this as relatives traveled from far away to support him in his new role. Both Jason and James contributed to the program through the invocation and introduction, respectively.

The Shrock family — Joel, wife Kelly, and twin sons JD and Brenton (missing oldest son Owen) — were all smiles as they gathered with extended family and the Graceland community in the Shaw Center Lobby after the ceremony.

He met Kelly at Ball State when the two were both on a university trip to the United Kingdom. He sat next to her on the bus because he wanted to meet her and talk to her. She promptly fell asleep.

When she awoke, he was still there, smiling at her, and they struck up a conversation that has kept going for 33 years. They have three boys: Owen, who is currently teaching English in Spain, and twins JD and Brenton, who are both nearing the end of their own undergraduate experiences at University of Findlay and Bellarmine University, respectively. Shrock’s countenance changes to pride when asked about his family. “I look up to my sons for being good, decent people who are so good at things I am not,” Shrock beamed. “And I look up to my spouse for being the most consummate professional I have ever seen and someone who provides me with so much support.”

Since being hired as VPAA, Shrock’s impact on Graceland has been significant. He was tasked with implementing Graceland’s bold model for liberal arts — a second major for all undergraduates calledTransformational Leadership. He also immediately worked on building bridges with faculty and hiring several new professors – 32 during his time in the role.

Shrock did his homework when he chose Graceland back in 2022 and his reasons for choosing Graceland then are the same reasons he pursued the position as President. “I chose this institution because of what it is and what it stands for,” he said in September when he accepted the role. “I chose Graceland because of who I am and what I stand for.”

Entering into his presidential leadership role, Shrock’s plan is to be laser-focused on three things:

• Create a strong student experience,• Make Graceland a great place to work, and• Drive revenue to the institution.

“None of these goals will be accomplished without some pain,” he said. “None will be accomplished without some transformation. To prosper into this century, Graceland will move forward boldly.”

Ishbel Wilson sees Shrock’s leadership carrying Graceland forward, saying, “He understands Graceland and the uniqueness of what that means – the housing system or the individual relationships people have with their professors. He really values what Graceland values.”

Shrock’s confidence is felt throughout the campus. His commitment to mission is clear: “We must remember what we are doing is worthwhile. We live in a world of large language models, artificial intelligence, misinformation, political polarization. The world needs universities. The world needs higher education. The world needs the liberal arts. The world needs this university.”

As the University looks to the future, his message to alumni is clear: “Graceland is alive and well. The University is embracing the historical values of Graceland while preparing for a new century,” he said. “We will continue to focus on providing the best experience we can for students, improving our facilities, and making the University a great place to work.”

That does not mean remaining stagnant, especially in the face of a higher education landscape that is becoming increasingly more challenging. Shrock believes the University cannot be afraid to change or to try new things or even perhaps to go back to older things, saying in his inauguration speech:

“What I know is that Graceland’s historical commitment to liberal arts, values of openness, and radical belonging will see us through whatever changes are on the horizon.”

Presidential Bingo NightInauguration week kicked off with a student event in Newcom Student Union as nearly 300 students gathered to win President Shrock-themed prizes, including two pairs of custom Nike Dunks (Shrock has his own pair of blue and gold ones).

One of the most coveted prizes from Presidential Bingo Night was going on the “Doc Shrock Presidential Walkabout” where Joel walks the campus taking Instagram photos for his@gracelandupresaccount.

Faculty Event:Carrying Radical Belonging ForwardGraceland faculty gathered to share academic work, engaging in an academic discussion about the future of education at the University. Held in the Shaw Center Atrium, the event included music, presentations from students and faculty, the creation of a community mosaic, and an alumni presentation from nonprofit HealthEd Connect.

Independence Program & ReceptionTo celebrate Graceland’s multi-campus presence, faculty, staff, and alumni gathered at Graceland’s Independence campus to share their support for President Shrock. The evening featured statements from alumni and academic leaders and musical performances from 21 Steele Strings, a group of Graceland alumni.

Trick-or-Treating at Carmichael HouseOn Halloween night, President Shrock and his wife Kelly hosted students and community members who wanted to trick-or-treat. They offered tours of the president’s house and plenty of sweets.

Inauguration CelebrationThe night before the inauguration, students, faculty, and staff on the Lamoni campus celebrated with an award-winning cover band, Mike Moody and the Outlaws, performing in the Shaw Center Atrium and were treated to snacks from Sodexo. Following the band’s performance, fireworks lit the sky over the Shaw Center, timed to a music playlist specifically highlighting some of President Shrock’s favorite tunes.

Inauguration CeremonyCommunity of Christ Presiding Bishop Ron Harmon Jr. ’86 and Graceland Board of Trustees Chair Mike Wiley ’83 formally invested President Shrock with the emblem of office, the presidential medallion. Forged in gold with the University seal, the pendant includes an image of the iconic Higdon Administration Building and the Latin phrase “Prudens Futuri” — wisdom for the future.
