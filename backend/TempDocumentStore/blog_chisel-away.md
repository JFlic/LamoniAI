127th Commencement

July 15, 2024 | Sierra Marshall ’21

Katie Bruels addressed the graduates at the December ceremony.

Graceland celebrated Fall Commencement on Dec. 16, 2023, at the Community of Christ Auditorium in Independence, Mo., as graduates from the School of Nursing, Community of Christ Seminary, and Gleazer School of Education joined by graduates of the Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics, and Master of Science in Nutrition and Human Performance programs proudly walked across the stage.

Katie Bruels, DNP, ’18 delivered the commencement address. A distinguished graduate of Graceland’s Doctor of Nursing Practice program, Bruels has held various leadership roles at Healthcare Corporation of America (HCA) for the past 16 years and now serves as Chief Nursing Executive for HCA Midwest Health. She emphasized the importance of practicing daily gratitude and striving to make a positive difference regardless of one’s circumstances. She also encouraged graduates to define their happiness in their chosen careers and to recognize their ability to create a better work-life atmosphere.

David Seda closed his speech by saying, “You’ve all been very kind, thank you very much. Class dismissed.”

Spring Commencement weekend, held April 27-28 in Lamoni, was full of memorable activities and remarkable individuals. The celebration began on Saturday with the Baccalaureate service, during which two students were honored with the prestigious Student Life Award: GSG President Peyton Anderson ’24 and COSA President Delaney Fox ’24. Vice President for Student Life Dave Schaal, EdD, ’80 acknowledged both recipients for their involvement in student government, house council, and various campus clubs, and for their significant contributions to the Graceland student community.

Sunday’s commencement ceremony was a joyful occasion as students prepared to receive their degrees and join the ranks of Graceland alumni. This year’s Spring Commencement speaker was David Seda, MA, ’83, who has held prominent positions at Apple, Cisco, and other tech companies like Microsoft, where he currently leads Azure AI. Seda’s speech was well-regarded by many, encouraging graduates not to be defined by their size in the world but to “chisel away” by asking the right questions and discovering their passions. He emphasized the importance of lifelong learning and assured the graduates that they were destined for greatness.

At Commencement in Lamoni, Bob Ackerley expressed how meaningful it is to be part of the Graceland community.

During the ceremony, Graceland also honored Bob Ackerley with an Honorary Degree. Ackerley and his family have been passionate supporters of the University, contributing to the outdoor track and endowing the prestigious Ackerley Scholarship for CSIT and Data Science majors.
