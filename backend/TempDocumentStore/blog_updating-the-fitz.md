The Fitzgerald Fitness Center opened in 2012 and was an effort to improve the health and well-being of students. Over the past seven years, “The Fitz,” as it’s known, has been a space of constant use for our students. Originally funded by a generous gift from Bob and Jan Braun ’61 Fitzgerald, the facility has three areas: a group exercise area for classes like yoga and Zumba, an aerobic area with elliptical machines and treadmills, and an anaerobic area that holds some small dumbbells, kettle bells and other free weights.

When students arrived in the fall of 2019, they were excited to find new equipment and greatly expanded fitness capabilities in the building. This equipment gives students the ability to explore new types of workouts and to enjoy brand-new elliptical machines and updated treadmills.

Greg Henson ’75 led the alumni charge and contributed the funds to help outfit and update the Fitz. He worked with Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students Dave Schaal, EdD, to ensure that the new equipment would enhance the student experience. “We had plans to update the equipment over the next several years, but with the help of our generous alumni, we were not only able to update all of the equipment at once, but we were also able to add things that we didn’t even envision being in the facility,” Schaal said. “Our students love it.”

Upgrades to existing buildings are an important part of keeping Graceland vibrant for our students. Thank you to Greg and the Fitzgeralds for their commitment to keeping our students healthy.
