April 9, 2013

April 18, 2013, Graceland University will host the third Annual Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education/Agricultural Business Scholarship Auction. The event will begin with a silent auction and heavy hor d’oeuvres at 6 p.m., with a live auction to begin at 7 p.m. Proceeds fund scholarships for Graceland Education and Agricultural Business students.

This year’s theme, World of Opportunities, reflects on the students’ desire to contribute to the global community. From helping teachers in Jamaican classrooms to strategizing how to feed the world’s population, the students have the potential to bring global changes.

The year’s auctioneer is former Iowa Congressman and Graceland alumnus, Leonard Boswell. Action items vary: from Kansas City Royals tickets to fresh lamb to Graceland apparel. The evening’s top prize is six nights, free lodging at “Castle Cliff” on the Lake of the Ozarks.

To join us, please RSVP by contacting Debbi Leialoha, atleialoha@graceland.eduor 816-588-6656, or Julie Breshears, at jbreshea@graceland.edu or 641-784-5170. The event costs $20 (for heavy hors’ devourers). Graceland’s Independence campus is located at 1401 W. Truman Road, Independence, MO.
