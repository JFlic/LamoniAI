Graceland University is one of the best colleges in the Midwest according to the nationally known education services company, The Princeton Review. It is one of 153 institutions The Princeton Review recommends in its “Best in the Midwest” section of its website feature, “2013 Best Colleges: Region by Region,” that August 20, 2012 on PrincetonReview.com. In the profile on Graceland University on its site, The Princeton Review says: “Graceland University creates and maintains high academic standards of excellence by prioritizing a close student/faculty learning environment, providing nurturing communities that foster intellectual engagement and curiosity, and embracing the philosophy that learning is not confined to the classroom.”

Says Robert Franek, Princeton Review’s Senior VP / Publisher, “We’re pleased to recommend Graceland University to users of our site as one of the best schools to earn their undergrad degree. We chose it and the other terrific institutions we name as ‘regional best’ colleges mainly for their excellent academic programs. From several hundred schools in each region, we winnowed our list based on institutional data we collected directly from the schools, our visits to schools over the years, and the opinions of our staff, plus college counselors and advisors whose recommendations we invite. We also take into account what students at the schools reported to us about their campus experiences at them on our 80-question student survey for this project. Only schools that permit us to independently survey their students are eligible to be considered for our regional ‘best’ lists.”

Graceland President Dr. John Sellars called the “Best in the Midwest” designation “…an important gauge of the emphasis Graceland continues to place on academic excellence and quality of life. These are capstones to the success of our students.”

The 153 colleges that The Princeton Review chose for its “Best in the Midwest” list are located in twelve states: Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. The Princeton Review also designated 222 colleges in the Northeast, 122 in the West, and 136 in the Southeast as best in their locales on the company’s “2013 Best Colleges: Region by Region” lists.  Collectively, the 633 colleges named “regional best(s)” constitute about 25 percent of the nation’s 2,500 four-year colleges.

The Princeton Review (www.PrincetonReview.com) is an education services company known for its test-prep courses, tutoring, books, and other student resources. Headquartered in Framingham, MA, with editorial offices in New York and locations across the U.S.A. and abroad, the Princeton Review, which is a privately held company, is not affiliated with Princeton University.
