The NAIA Eligibility Center is responsible for determining the NAIA eligibility of first-time student-athletes. Any student playing NAIA sports for the first time must meet the eligibility requirements. Students must have their eligibility determined by the NAIA Eligibility Center, and all NAIA schools are bound by the centers decisions.

Who needs to register?

Every student interested in playing sports at NAIA colleges for the first time in 2011-12 or any year after that needs to register and have a determination if they are eligible to play.

If you have already registered at PlayNAIA.org, please provide us with your NAIA ID. You can find your NAIA ID by logging intoPlayNAIA.organd looking in the red box in the upper right hand corner. Your NAIA ID should be 7 numbers long.
