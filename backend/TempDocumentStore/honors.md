Graceland’s Honors Program is a powerful, inclusive community designed to nurture your particular gifts and skills. We’re proud of all the things our Honors Program alumni have accomplished: bringing great ideas to life through their writing, art, and teaching; working to restore peace and justice throughout the world; fighting illness and disease in hospitals and research facilities across the nation; and much more.

We’re looking for students with a record of academic excellence that includes:

We also know that there are many different ways to measure success. If you’re interested in being a part of the honors program, but you don’t meet these exact requirements, please contact our Admissions Office.

The Honors Program will also accept applications from current Graceland students—especially current first- and second-year students—who have established a record of academic success. The application process is the same: just tick the “current Graceland student” box.

If you wish to be considered for the Prestigious Honors Scholarship, you must apply to the Honors Program at least one week prior to the Academic Honors Day in which you will compete for the award.

Your honors classes bring students from diverse academic, intellectual, and personal experiences into a conversation with one another—and it is this type of interdisciplinary thinking that will develop the leaders of the future who can solve tomorrow’s problems. You will develop customized individual research projects with your faculty mentors where you pursue the ideas you are most passionate about. Plus, you’ll also enjoy extra benefits, like the freedom to register for up to 21 credits each semester, funded travel experiences, individualized mentorship, and more.

By participating in the Honors Program, you may also qualify for the Honors Program scholarship which is renewable for up to four years(excluding recipients of the Prestigious Honors Scholarship).
