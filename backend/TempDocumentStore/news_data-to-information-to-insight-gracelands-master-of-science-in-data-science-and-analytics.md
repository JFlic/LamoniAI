Data permeates our world.

Scientists believe that by the year 2025, human beings will produce over 450 exabytes of data worldwide. That’s a 450 billion BILLION bytes. Every. Single. Day. With so much information at our fingertips, businesses and organizations worldwide are investing heavily in understanding data through the emerging field of data science.

In 2020, Graceland University launched its Data Science and Analytics program that prepares students to transform data to information and then take that information and build insight through analysis that gives people the ability to take action.

Headed by Jeff Draves, PhD, Graceland is excited to launch its latest online postgraduate program to students: a Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics.

“Our approach provides students with real world scenarios and real data sets that take theoretical analysis and move it into practical use,” said Draves.

Named the “sexiest job in America” by theHarvard Business Review, data science is a rapidly growing industry with average starting salaries in excess of $118,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

There were 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every 2 days.” – Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google

Graceland’sMaster of Science in Data Science and Analyticsdegree is a 33-hour program that can be completed quickly so graduates can start taking advantage of their education to further their career. With emphasis options in either Machine Learning or Environmental Analytics, students will graduate with real-world skills that can be applied immediately.
