GETTING. THINGS. DONE.

AmeriCorps is a national service movement that supports the engagement of Americans of all ages and backgrounds in service to address the most critical needs of education, public safety, the environment, homeland security and other human needs in our nation’s communities.

Graceland University AmeriCorps Youth Launch (AYL) provides positive youth development activities that build a youth-serving network in a six-county region in south-central Iowa. The AYL program assists students in achieving academic engagement and educational success by building developmental assets through the involvement and support of community partners. The mission of AYL is to provide opportunities for students to lead successful, rewarding and productive lives. AmeriCorps members build valuable developmental assets, instill civic engagement and help young people find the “sparks” that ignite their passions in life. AmeriCorps members serve in school-based and/or community-based host sites, developing and strengthening programs that promote positive youth development. Through partnerships with various community entities and volunteers, members will promote enrichment activities to strengthen and sustain out-of-school programming and to fulfill the goals of the AYL program. Enrichment activities may include career shadowing, drama, drug prevention, nutrition, life skills, personal safety and recreation.

As an AmeriCorps member, you will gain valuable experience that translates directly into job experience in your chosen field. You will learn teamwork, communication, responsibility and other essential skills that will help you for the rest of your life. Many find their AmeriCorps year of service provides them with more experience and skills than they would have gotten in a traditional paying job.

In addition to professional growth, many members find personal growth through the knowledge that they have made a difference in someone else’s life. Lifelong friendships are formed, interpersonal skills are learned and community connections are made.
