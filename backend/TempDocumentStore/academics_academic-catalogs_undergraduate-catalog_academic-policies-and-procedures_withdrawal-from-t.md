# Withdrawal from the University | Graceland

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/academics/academic-catalogs/undergraduate-catalog/academic-policies-and-procedures/withdrawal-from-the-university/#top

Students not returning to Graceland for the next semester or term, including graduating students, are required to officially initiate the withdrawal process. Lamoni Campus students withdrawing or not returning to Graceland must formally notify Student Life of intent to withdraw and initiate the withdrawal process by visiting the Success Studio, lower level of the Library. Students from other programs withdrawing or not returning to Graceland must formally notify their program advisor or site coordinator of intent to withdraw and initiate the withdrawal process.

Refund of the institutional deposit balance, net of any outstanding charges and contingent upon successful initiation of the withdrawal process and completion of the checkout process, will be mailed to the student’s home address as soon as processing can be completed at the end of the semester or term.

Individual policies for Course Withdrawal may vary by program. Withdrawal from courses after the last day to withdraw will follow the standard Refund Policy. Contact your Program Advisor, the Registrar’s Office, or Student Financial Services with specific questions.

An unofficial withdrawal occurs when a student elects to cease participation in courses and fails to notify Graceland University of his/her intent to withdraw. At the end of each session a review will be conducted of any student who received all “F” or “W” grades. The review will determine if the student earned the failing grades or if the student ceased participation and the situation is deemed an unofficial withdrawal. A student receiving a passing grade for a session course is considered to have been in attendance and earned all grades. The last date of attendance will be the most recent last day of academically related activity as noted by each course faculty. If a last day of academically related activity is unable to be determined, the last date of attendance will be the midpoint of the session.

### Mobilization of Students to Active Duty in the Military

Students who are called into active military duty, and the spouse of service members with a dependent child(ren) who are called into active military duty, including the National Guard and Reserve active duty, during the course of an academic term may receive refunds and course credits.
