Robert A. Poulton, PhD, is professor of economics at Graceland University’s C. H. Sandage School of Business. As an undergraduate at Wittenberg University, he began studying economics as preparation for law school. After his second course, though, he was hooked.

Dr. Poulton loved the way economics allowed him to see the world differently and solve complex problems. He appreciated that it was the part of the liberal arts that connected to the business world. He soon chose a different path and proceeded to graduate study in economics, where he specialized in industrial organization and public finance.

Dr. Poulton expresses how incredibly blessed he feels to have found his passion and to now have a chance to share this passion with his students. His goal every semester is to show the beauty of economics by bringing it to life in the classroom and accomplishes this by giving students the opportunity to experience economic phenomena, through in-class demonstrations, competitive business simulations, case studies, mock courts and economic summits.

As a graduate student instructor at Penn State, Dr. Poulton taught classes of over 100 students. At Graceland, the small class sizes allow him to get to know his students. He can give them individual tutoring outside of the classroom, help them with their research, serve as their academic advisor, collaborate with their economics club and even compete against them on the basketball court during intramural season.

“I believe that life-long learning happens when we are actively engaged in memorable experiences. Seeing students grow over their four years at Graceland and transform into successful career professionals is the most rewarding aspect of my job.”
