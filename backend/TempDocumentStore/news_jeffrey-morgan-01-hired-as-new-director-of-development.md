Vice President for Institutional Advancement Kristi Hettrick ’96 announced Jeffrey Morgan ’01 as Graceland’s newest Director of Development. Morgan previously served as Director and Co-Owner of Performance Volleyball Academy (PVA), where he grew the club from 23 teams to 42 teams and focused on fostering community with players and their families.

As a student, Morgan was recruited from his hometown of St. Louis, Mo., to play volleyball at Graceland in 1997, where he graduated with a degree in Business Administration and Management. After college, he worked as an Electronic Enrollment Specialist at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City for almost ten years before launching PVA.

When asked about returning to Graceland, Morgan said, “I look forward to hearing from and getting to know all of Graceland’s alumni. I have friends from my days on “the Hill,” but I can’t wait to build new relationships with other alumni and hear about their unique Graceland experience.”

As the Institutional Advancement team continues to grow, they eagerly extend a warm welcome to their newest member. “We are excited to have Jeff join the Major Gifts team,” said Rick Isham ‘82, Senior Director of Major Gifts. “His personal Graceland story and professional background will prove invaluable in working with alumni and friends to support institutional success.”

Hettrick said, “Our team is thrilled to welcome Jeff back to ‘the Hill.’ I am grateful he will be working with our Development team connecting with alumni and supporters of Graceland, and ensuring our students have the resources they need to be successful at Graceland and in the workforce.”
