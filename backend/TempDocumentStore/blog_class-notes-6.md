Cassandra Fronatt `17learned more than she expected when she began her study abroad program. Cassandra traveled to Athens, Greece, with the Atlantis Fellowship Project, a medical internship program that originated in Washington, D.C.

While there, she had the opportunity to shadow many different doctors in hospitals over the course of a month.

“We shadowed in the hospitals, both private and public ones, from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. every weekday and then had free time to explore and for group activities on our days off,” Cassandra recalled.

This program allowed Cassandra to observe a number of diverse areas and specialties within the hospitals. It also gave her a glance into the discrepancies between the public and private hospital sectors.

“Every day we switched specialties so we could get a glimpse at as much as possible. Some days I saw cardiac surgeries, brain surgeries, general surgeries, orthopedic surgeries and others while I was in the ER or ER Pathology.”

Currently, Cassandra is working as lead medical assistant at Rapid Med Urgent Care in Double Oak, Texas.
