## STORY  OF  THE  CAPTURE

Suffering  of  F unston  and  Compan* ions  on  the  M arch.

Manila,  -March  29.-A guinaldo,  who was captured  by General  F unston and brought  to  Manila  on t h o United .Slates gunboat Vicksburg, was brought  ashore  at  3:10  p.  m.  yester­ day  and  taken  before  G eneral  MacA rth u r a t th e  M alacanang' palace,  lie ta lk e d f r e e h , but  seem ed  ignorant concerning  recent  e\ents. l i e ap­ peared  to  be  in  good  h ea lth   and  was even  chcerlul. lie  lunched  w ith  tlie oilicers  of  General  M ucA rthur's  staff, and  was  then  escorted  to   th e  Anda s t r e e t   ja il

General  Funston  give*;  o u t  th e   fol­ lowing  story  of  the  cap tu re:

'Ou  the  night  of  M arch  8  th e   p arty who  were  to  go  after  A guinaldo  em­ barked  on  the  I'nited  S tate s  gunboat Vicksburg. J t   w as  o rig in a lly   in te n d ­ ed  to   laice  caseoes  from   th e   island >f  1'olillo  and  to  d rift  to   th e   mainind,  b u t  a  storm   arose  an d   th re e   of he  caseoes  were  lost. This  plan  was il-andoncd. At  2  a m.  M arch  14  tho Vicksburg pui  her  lights  o u t  and  ran in sore  twenty-Jivc  m iles  south  of Casiguran,  province  of  P rincipe. The parly  landed  and  marched  lo  Casiguran The  Americans  had  never  gar­ risoned  tins  place,  and  th e  inhabi­ t a n t s   a r e   s tr o n g  in s u r g e n t  s y m p a th iz ­ ers. Having  arrived  th ere  the  cxin su rg c n t officers, ostensibly com­ manding  the  party,  announced  that th e y   w ere  on  th e  way  to   jo in   Agninalflo  between  l 'atitobang  and  Baler; llia t  th e y   had  su rp rised  an   A m erican surveying  party,  and  th a t  th e y   had killed  a  num ber,  capturing  live. They exhibited  General  Funston  nnd  the other  Americans  as  their  prisoners.

The  insurgent  president  of  Casigura.n  believed  the  story. Two  of  the Lacuna  letters,  previously  concocted, were  forwarded  to Aguinaldo  a t I'alannna,  province  of  Isabella. General Funslon  and  1he  others  w ere  kept imprisoned  for  three  da^s,  surrep­ titio u sly   giving  orders  a(  n ig h l. On  a small  quantity  of  crackers  and  corn, th e   p a r ly   s ta rte d   on  a  n in e ty   mile march  to  Palanan. The  country  is rough and  uninhabited  and  pro\isions could  n o t  be  secured. The  p a rty   ate small  shell  fish,  but were almost starved. Wading  swift,  riv ers,  climb­ ing  precipitous  m ountains  and  pene­ t r a t i n g   d ense  jungles,  th e y   m arched seven  days  and  nights,  and  March 22  had  reached  a  point  e ig h t  miles from  Palanan. They  were  now  so weak  th a t  it.  w as  necessary  to   send to  A guinaldo's camp for food. Agninaldo  dispatched  supplies  and  directed t h a t   t h e   A m erican  p riso n ers  b e  kind­ ly t r e a t e d , but  not  be  allow ed  to cnic.r  th e  town.

On the morning of March  23  the  ad­ vance  was  resumed The  colum n  was met  by the stafT oilicers of A gujnaldo's body  guard,  which  was  ordered  to ta k e   c h a rg e   of  th e  A m ericans.

AVliile  one  of  1hc  ex-insurtreni.  offi­ cers  conversed  w ith  A guinaklo's  aide, to  w arn   General  l-'unston t h e rest who,  w ith  eleven  Maeabebes,  were about  an  hour  behind. Having  re­ ceived  this  w arning  General  Funston avoided  AguinaUlo's  detachm ent  and joined  column,  avoiding  observation. Tlie Tagalos went  ahead  to   g reet Aguinaldo  and  the  column  slow ly  fol­ lowed,  finally  arriving  a t  I'alan an .

Aguinaldo's  household  troops,  fifty men  in  neat  uniform s  of  blue  and white  and  w earing  straw   h a ts,  lined up  fo  receive  the  ncweomers. Gen­ eral  F unston's  men  crossed  tho  river in  sm all  boats,  formed  on  th e   banks, and  m arched  to  the  right  and  then in  f r o n t  o f  th e  insurgent,  g re n a d ie rs . The  Tagalos  entered  the  house  w here Aguinaldo  was.

Suddenly  the  Spanish  officer,  notic­ ing  th a t  AguinaM o's  aide  w as  w atch­ ing  th e   A m ericans  suspiciously,  ex­ claim ed-

·'Now,  Macabebes,  go  for  th e m  ' The  Macabebes  opened fire, but t h e i r   a im   w as  r a th e r   ineffective,  nnd only  three,  insurgents were killed The  rebels  returned  the  fire. On hearing  the  firing,  Aguinaldo,  who evidently thought his men  w ere  m ere­ ly  c e le b ra tin g  th e   arriv al  of  r e in f o r c e ­ ments,  ran  to  the  window  and  sh o u t­ ed,  ' S top  1haf  foolishness;  q u it  w a st­ ing am m unition.'

l l i l a r i o Placido,  one  of  th e  Tagalo officers  and  a  form er  in su rg en t  m a­ jo r,  w ho  was  wounded  in  th e  lu n g   by the  fire  of  the  Kansas  reg im en t  at th e b a t t l e of  Calooean,  1hrew   his arm s  around  Aguinaldo,  exclaim ing; 'You  ure  a  prisoner  of  th e  A m eri­ cans.'

Colonel  Simeon  Villa.  A guinaldo'n chief  of  staff: Major  A lam bra  and others  attacked  the  men who  were holding  Aguinaldo. I'laeido  s h o t  Villia  in  th e   shoulder. Alambra  jum ped out  of  th e  window'  and  a tte m p te d   to cross  th e  river. I t   is  su p p o se d   t h a t he  w as  drowned. Five  o th e r  in s u r­ gent  officers  fought  for  a  few   m in­ utes  and  then  fled,  m aking  th e ir  es­ cape.

Wien  the  firing  began. General Funston  assumed  command  and  di­ rected  the  attack  on  the  house,  p er­ sonally  assisting  in  the  cap tu re  of Aguinaldo. The in s u rg e n t body guard  fled,  leaving  tw enty  rifles. San­ tiago  lia rc d o n a ,  th e   in s u rg e n t  tr e a s ­ urer,  surrendered  without,  resistence.

■\Vhen  captured,  Aguinaldo  w as  tre ­ mendously excited,  but  he  calmed down  under  General  Funslon's  assu r­ ance  1hni  he  would  be  well  tre a te d . General  Funston  secured  all  of A gujn­ aldo's  correspondence,  show ing  th a t he  had  kept  in  vlose  touch  w ith   the sub-chiefs  of  the  insurrection  in  all p a r t s   o f  th e   a n  hipelago. I t   w a s   a lso discovered  that  Airuinaldo,  Ja n u ary 28,  had  proclaimed  him self  d ic tato r. JTe  had  been  living  a t  I'ala n a n   fo r seven months, undisturbed except wlien  a  detachm ent  of  the  S ix teen th i n f a n t r y visited  the  town;, On  th a t occasion  th e  entire  population  took to   flic  m o u n ta in s  and  rem ained  th e re until  th e   tro o p s  retired.\_\_\_<

A woman is sick-some disease peculiar to her sex is fast developing in her system. She goes to  her  family  physician aud tells him a story, but not the whole story.

She  holds  back  something,  loses  her  head, becomes agi­ tated.  forgets  what  she  wants  to  say,  and  finally  conceals what  she  ought  to  havo  told,  and  this completely  mystifies the doctor.

Is it a wonder, therefore, that the doctor fails to cure  the disease ? Still we cannot blame the woman, for it is very em­ barrassing  to detail some  of  the symptoms  of  her  suffering, even  to  her  family  physician. This  is  tlio  rea so n   w h y hundreds o f thousands o f w o m en  are now   in   corre­ s p o n d e n c e   w it h   M rs.  P i n k h a m ,  a t  L y n n ,  M ass. To her they can give every symptom,  so  that  when she is ready to  advise  them  she  is  in  possession  of  more facts  from  her correspondence  with  the  patient  than  the  physician  can possibly  obtain through a personal interview.

Following wo publish a letter from a woman showing tho result  of  a  correspondence  with  Mrs.  Pinkham. All  su ch l e t t e r s aro  considered  a b so lu te ly   co n fid en tia l by Mrs.  P in k h n m ,  and  are  never  published  in any  way  or manner  without the consent  in  writing  of  the  patient;  but hundreds of women are so grateful for tho health which Mrs. Pinkhain and her medicino havo been able to restore to them that  they  I'.o t  only  consent  to  publishing  their  letters,  but write  asking  that  this  bo  done  in  order  that  othor  womea who  suffer  may  bo  benefited  by  their  experience.

## Mrs.  Ella Rice, Chelsea,  W is., w rites:

' D e a h   Mr.?.  P i x k u a m : - F or  tw o   y e a rs  I   w as  troubled  w ith  fa llin g aud inflammation of the womb. I  suffered  very  much  w ith  bearing-down pains,  headache,  baekaclic,  and  w as  n o t  alilo  to  do  anything. What  1 endured  no  one  knows  but  those  who  have  suffered  as  1  did. 1  could hardly drug myself across the floor. I  doctored with the physicians of th is town for  th ree  months  and  grew   w orse  instead  of  better. My husband and friends wished me to write to you,  b u t I  hud no faith  in  patent  m edi­ cine.-,. At last 1  became  so  bad  th a t  I  concluded  to\_ai.lt  your  advice. I received an answer at once advising me to take your Vegetable Compound, and I did so. Before I had taken two bottles I felt better, and after I had t a k e n   l i v e bottles there was no  happier  woman  on  earth,  for  I  was  w ell cirain J  k n o w   th a t your  V egetable  Com pound cured me,  and  I  wish  and advise every woman who suffers as  I  did  to try  Lydia E. Pinkham 's Vege­ table  Compound. Believe  me  ah v a \s  g rate fu l  for  the  leeovery  of  my health.'-  Mus.  Eixa  Uick,  Chelsea,  Wis.

## EDUCATE  YOUR  BOWELS

Don't  neglect  the  slightest  sign  of  irregularity but see  that  you  have  at  least  one  natural, easy  movement a  day. Pills,  salts  and  black  draughts  are  dangerous because  they  strain  and  weaken  the  bowels. What you want is a mild but sure tonic laxative, that tones and strengthens  the  bowels  and  stimulates their movements. Such  a  laxative  is  CASCARETS,  and  when  you try  them,  you  will  find  that  it  is  the  easiest  thing  in the  world  to  make  and  keep  your  bowels  clean  and regular, strong and healthy.
