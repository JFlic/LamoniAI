Here’s to a great new year!

January 22, 2025

Happy New Year! As we step into 2025, I’m filled with excitement and hope for what this year holds for Graceland University. I wanted to take a moment to share some of the incredible things happening at our university—opportunities that honor our legacy and position us for a bright future.

First, we’re thrilled to announce thelaunch of our Nursing program in Lamoni!This expansion builds on Graceland’s longstanding commitment to health education. By bringing this vital program to Lamoni while still investing in our heraldedprogram in Independence, we’re strengthening our ability to meet the region’s healthcare needs and opening new doors for our students.

We’re also making great strides on theHenson Strength and Conditioning Center. This facility represents our commitment to enhancing the student-athlete experience, and I can’t wait to see how it will support their pursuit of excellence on and off the field. Part of the exciting aspect of this development is it allows us tolaunch…our Women’s Wrestling program.This dynamic addition reflects Graceland’s proud history of innovation and inclusion in athletics. Women’s Wrestling brings fresh energy to our athletics community, and we’re excited for our newest competitors to make their mark.

We have also made severalimprovements to the residence hallsrecently: replacing nearly all the showers in Tess Morgan, rolling out improvements to the lounges in all buildings, and working hard to stay on top of upkeep and maintenance in our historic buildings.

On a bittersweet note, we’re preparing to say goodbye to our Vice President for Student Life and Dean of StudentsDave Schaal, who has served Graceland with immense dedication over the years. His retirement is well-deserved, and while his presence will be deeply missed, his legacy of care and leadership will continue to inspire us.

My three areas of focus as president: invest in the student experience, improve our revenue streams, and ensure that Graceland is a great place to work. These areas and so many more show that the spirit of possibility is alive and well at Graceland as we look ahead to 2025. Thank you for the many ways you’ve contributed to the success of our students and university. Your ongoing support makes these moments possible.

Here’s to a wonderful year!
