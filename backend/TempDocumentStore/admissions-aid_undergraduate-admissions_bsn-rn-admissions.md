Graceland School of Nursing helps prepare nursing students to become Registered Nurses through their education during completion of a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing. Then they take the NCLEX (state licensure exam to become a Registered Nurse) completed after graduation.

Graceland offers a 24 month track that begins each January and an 18 month track that begins in June of each year. Students do NOT need to have a previous bachelor degree in another area for consideration to our program. Both tracks graduate in December of the following year.

It is strongly recommended that applications are submitted prior to these dates to ensure paperwork is completed in time for the first round of application reviews. Applications submitted after this date will be considered as space permits, and for the respective cohort waitlist.

Tuition Deposit— Accepted students will pay a $200, non-refundable deposit. This deposit will apply toward their tuition.

Unofficial TranscriptsYou may submit unofficial transcripts, for a pre-evaluation. This pre-evaluation is completed to help applicants determine if they are eligible for the program. If applicants are currently in courses and meet all other requirements, the unofficial transcript can be used until a final official transcript can be obtained.

Unofficial Transcripts can be sent toadmissions@graceland.edu. Use the subject line: BSN pre-evaluation

Official Transcripts

Submitofficialtranscripts fromALLcolleges ever attended. Graceland prefers transcripts be sent electronically, however, paper transcripts will be accepted if received in a sealed envelope from the requested institution. Final official transcripts must be received prior to starting classes.

Please request official transcripts be sent to:Graceland University, 1 University Place, Lamoni, IA 50140

ORadmissions@graceland.edu.

There are 24 seats available in the January cohort and 51 seats available in the June cohort.

Applications are reviewed after all documents have been received. The School of Nursing may request an interview or additional documentation from the applicant before making an acceptance decision.

For applicants who still need courses or are currently taking courses, your application will be reviewed but an acceptance decision may not be made at that time. You will receive communication letting you know what is needed before an official decision is made.

Once the cohort is filled, accepted students will have the option of being put on the waiting list or moving their application to the next cohort. If a seat in the current cohort opens, candidates will be chosen from that list. Seats are confirmed only when the applicant has been accepted and pays the $200 deposit. All courses needed must be completed prior to the start of classes.

We have day-time classes that all the junior students attend together. Students should plan on a full time commitment.We encourage students not to work during the first two semesters of nursing school. This gives them a chance to adjust to the challenges of this accelerated nursing program. Later, some students may try to work, but we encourage them to have flexible work hours so there is adequate study time so as not to compromise grades.

The Graceland Independence Campus is a non-residential campus. Most classes we hold on our campus, close to the Historic Independence Square and Harry S. Truman home. There are older homes with apartments, and various apartment buildings in a wide price range, around the greater Kansas City metropolitan area. Living close to the campus could prove beneficial to have a shorted drive time, especially in bad weather.

Students begin clinical rotations in the fall semester. They will assigned to clinical sites at different hospitals in the Greater Kansas City area, throughout the program.

Not only are students learning to provide patient care, but they also become familiar with several hospitals. This helps them consider where they want to seek employment when they graduate.

There are 561 clinical hours in the nursing curriculum.

Students applying to the School of Nursing must have minimum of 61 hours of credit successfully completed before our program begins in June. Additional elective hours may be needed.

Students must have CumulativeGPA of 2.75 of all college work OR a Prerequisite Course GPA of 2.75.

Transfer students must meet Communications, Humanities, Social Sciences & Math/Science categories. Students who already have a degree in another major, need ONLY the prerequisite courses.

choose from Literature, Philosophy, Music, Art, Religion, Theatre, Foreign Language

Prerequisite courses* must have minimum grade of C, preferably higher.

**Students with lower English grades will need to retake the course(s) before June start date.

TheTest of Essential Academic Skills V (TEAS V)assesses the entry-level academic readiness of nursing program applicants in reading, mathematics, science and English and language. Signing up to take the TEAS Exam is part of completing the application process, even if the actual exam is taken after the application due date.

We accept a previous TEAS Exam score if taken less than one year prior to the application due date (September 30 of the year before you plan to start the program).  If the overall TEAS exam score is 80% or higher, we will accept an exam taken less than 1 and a half years prior to the application due date.

For example, if you were applying to start in June of 2021, the application due date was September 30, 2020. Therefore, the TEAS exam must have been taken no earlier than September 30, 2019, OR March 31, 2019, f the overall score is 80% or higher.

If applying for a later start date, please reach out to Susan Freeze for details about your TEAS test.

Graceland gives the TEAS proctored exam on selected dates in August, September and January.

Students register and pay to take the exam on the ATI websitewww.atitesting.com. The days and times of test dates will be posted on the ATI website. If an exam day is filled, it will not be visible.
