Lamoni, Iowa, is just 250 miles from the actual center of the continental U.S.It’s not far off to say Graceland is literally in the middle of the country — but Graceland’s reach spans much farther.Since early in its history, Graceland has attracted students from all over the world. Students who come to Graceland from their corner of the world soon leave with a network that spans the globe, and, in every corner, Graceland values are alive.

Regardless of where Graceland students come from or where Graceland alumni end up, one common thread remains —an appreciation for their alma materand thelasting connections and experiencesthey received while on campus. These threads have led to a web of Graceland alumni that spans the world.
