Maternal Newborn Nursing Care Plans Third Edition by Graceland University Professor of Nursing Dr. Carol Green

Graceland University Professor of Nursing Carol J. Green, PhD, CNS, RN, CNE authored the textbook Maternal Newborn Nursing Care Plans Third Edition, which has been published and is for sale by Jones & Bartlett Learning. Cindy Waits, Graceland University Assistant Professor of Nursing, also contributed two chapters to the book.

Maternal Newborn Nursing Care Plans, Third Edition teaches students and practicing nurses how to assess, plan, provide and evaluate care for pregnancy, delivery, recovery, abnormal conditions and newborn care. Featuring more than 65 of the most common and high-risk care plans for nursing care using the nursing process approach, it includes NIC interventions, discussions on collaborative problems, key nursing activities, signs and symptoms, and diagnostic studies. Using a progressive approach, the text begins with generic care plans that address all patient situations regardless of the patient diagnosis or condition before moving on to more complicated and specific care plans.

Dr. Carol Green has been a nurse educator for over 28 years. Currently, she teaches in the graduate program at Graceland University School of Nursing in Independence, Missouri. She is the author of Critical Thinking in Nursing: Case Studies across the Curriculum, author of Maternal and Newborn Nursing Care Plans, co-editor of Phipps’s Medical Surgical Nursing, and co-author of the 2011 edition of Swearingen’s Manual of Medical-Surgical Nursing.

You can read more about Green and find more information and purchase the book on the Jones & Bartlett Learning website.
