December 22, 2022 | Georgia Seagraves

Commencement weekend began on Saturday, April 30, 2022, with the baccalaureate service held in the Shaw Family Auditorium. Vice President for Student Life Dave Schaal ’80 announced the Student Life Award recipients — Rachel Hawley ’22 and Casey Main ’22 — recognizing their superior leadership and selfless service to the Graceland community.

On Sunday, May 1, at 10 a.m., family, friends, and students filed into a bright gymnasium as the commotion of community filled the room. On this cold and blustery day, President Patricia H. Draves greeted graduates and their families and was then joined by several international students who welcomed those present in their native languages. Faculty awards were presented to Tanya Coffelt, EdD, Beth Gregory, EdD, and Donovan Nelson, EdD (more about the recipients in the sidebar).

The commencement address was given by Dr. Matthew Naylor, President and CEO of the National WWI Museum and Memorial. With passion and fervor, he spoke directly to the room of graduates:

“Because of your time here at Graceland, because of your experience, of being shaped by the pandemic, taking all of that, what you learned, and what you are becoming, you are remarkably equipped to take on these challenges, these opportunities, to confront and do what needs to be done. You are prepared like no other generation. Now go do it.”
