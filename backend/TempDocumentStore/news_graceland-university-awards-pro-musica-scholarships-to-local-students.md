Graceland University awarded three prestigious Pro Musica Performance Scholarships for the 2017-18 academic year to local students. A limited number of these awards are given each year to outstanding students enrolled in the university and pursuing a degree in music. Students were required to complete applications and auditions, submit a letter of recommendation and confirm their enrollment at Graceland by May 1.

Multiple auditions have been performed over the past several weeks to determine the beneficiaries of this highly competitive scholarship. Erin Bodnar, D.M.A., Director of Bands/Assistant Professor of Music expressed, “The music faculty has been impressed with the caliber of auditions for the new Pro-Musica scholarships we are offering this year. These three scholarships are being awarded to future music majors who will be leaders in helping to continue the growth of our Music Department at Graceland University.”

The first recipient of this premier scholarship is Dora Martz from Worth County R-III School in Grant City, Missouri. In November 2016, Dora performed a vocal audition that won her the award. She has committed to a fall enrollment with a major in music. “I am very excited for Dora to join the Graceland University choral/vocal program this fall. Her desire to pursue studies in vocal music education demonstrates a strong commitment to continuing to develop her talents and love for the art. We are very fortunate to have her joining us this fall!” -Sara Blessing, Graceland University Director of Choral/Vocal Activities.

Emily Briggs from Eagleville, Missouri is the second recipient of the Pro Musica Performance Scholarship. Emily auditioned for the Graceland University Drumline at Academic Honors Day in February. Currently attending North Harrison High School, Emily is a percussionist and has also committed to attending Graceland as a music major in the fall.

Jared Wood of Gower, Missouri’s East Buchanan High School is the third recipient for the prestigious scholarship. Jared will be joining Graceland’s band as a tubist and will also add his vocal talents to the choral program. He plans to study music education. “Jared’s audition this spring, as well as his past achievements indicate that he will be an active and involved musician at Graceland University. As director of Graceland’s band program, I am pleased to add his talents to our ensemble and look forward to contributing to his musical development.”—Erin Bodnar

Per the Pro Musica Scholarship requirements, each benefactor must meet eligibility on a per semester basis by maintaining a 3.0 overall grade point average and be enrolled as a music major. As a vocalist, Dora will participate in both concert choir and chamber choir as her primary ensembles. Because percussionists are required to enroll in at least two different ensembles, Emily will have the ability to choose from symphonic band, jazz band, orchestra or drumline as her primary ensembles. As a dual talent, Jared will have options in the choral/vocal category and/or choices of instrumental ensembles.

Graceland is excited to watch these talented musicians grow personally, musically and academically. Congratulations and welcome to Graceland, Pro Musica Performance Scholarship recipients!
