Rebecca Reddell, aka Becky, is a lifelong learner who appreciates new challenges and new learning opportunities. Her love of reading and writing developed into her love of education and languages. She’s a huge supporter of learning, growing, and shining in what gives you joy. Her hope for her students is that they will find skills and strategies to employ in their own classrooms while cultivating their own strengths as instructors.

As an educator, she spent eight years in the elementary classroom and delighted in assisting students to find their own excitement in reading. Her passion for a good story led to some thrilling read-alouds with her second graders picking up those books again and again. Leading her students one year to become the second-highest second grade class in the district to achieve an average of two and a half years reading growth is one of her proudest moments in teaching. She received her master’s during her first year in the classroom through the University of Missouri – Columbia’s Teacher Fellowship Program and found it to be an exhausting and rewarding experience.

Becky is a self-published author of four fairytale retelling YA novels, three poetry books, and the first book in her Christian Historical fiction hometown series. In November of 2023, she was invited to participate in the Mid-Continent Public Library’s Local Author Event where she met several amazing authors. She writes as fast as her fingers will allow, could talk to you about writing and reading nonstop, and encourages conversations about all things literary.

In her spare time, she is actively learning new languages and has three certificates of completion in basic ASL, loves to play with her mini-Aussie Bella, keeps in touch with her international penpals, watches foreign tv & movies, and reads way too many books. If you suggest a new book, share a coffee or tea, donate chocolate, or keep her supplied in kimchi, she will be your best friend for life. She’s excited to be a part of the Graceland family and hopes to inspire new educators to love what they do and succeed at what they love.

“Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It's splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world.”― L.M. Montgomery, Anne of Green Gables
