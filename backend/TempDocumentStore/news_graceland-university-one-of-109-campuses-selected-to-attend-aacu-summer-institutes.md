The Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) has announced the list of colleges, community colleges, universities and state systems sending teams to its three regularly scheduled 2014 summer institutes for teams, and it includes Graceland University.

“The 2014 AAC&U summer institutes will bring together teams to focus on exactly how institutions can ensure that all students achieve liberal education outcomes that are so essential for success in the twenty-first century,” said AAC&U President Carol Geary Schneider.

All AAC&U institutes offer campus teams a time and place for sustained collaborative work on a project of importance to their campus, along with a curriculum focused on important trends, research and best practices, and a resident faculty of educational experts.

“It’s pretty wonderful for Graceland to be invited to join in this week of working together with other universities on liberal arts education and student success. We’ve got a good team going, and I’m thrilled to be included,” said Paul Davis, CIO at Graceland University.

Graceland is participating in the Institute on High-Impact Practices and Student Success, which is designed for institutions at various stages of work, and addresses ambitious goals for improving both completion rates and the quality of student learning. Participant teams address barriers to student success and devise integrative learning-centered plans, making intentional use of Essential Learning Outcomes and high-impact educational practices. Highlighting the success of students from groups that have historically been underserved, the program supports work to make excellence inclusive.
