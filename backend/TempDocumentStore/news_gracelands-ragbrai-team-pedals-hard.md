Good news, Graceland: Team Yellowjacket survived last year’s RAGBRAI and will shift into gear again July 22-28.

For the second year in a row, a dozen university alumni and friends will pedal across the state during the (Des Moines) Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa to raise money for student scholarships. They’ll join more than 10,000 other spandex-clad riders along this year’s 471-mile eastward trek from Sioux Center, near the Missouri River, and Clinton, on the Mississippi.

It’s not a race, but it will be a challenge. Riders can expect to pedal 60 to 80 miles each day, with a few rolling hills and high temperatures to keep things interesting. (The real challenge, as last year’s team can tell you, is eating all the homemade pie from roadside vendors along the way.) Team Yellowjacket will stay with Graceland alumni and Community of Christ congregations in each of the seven overnight towns: Sioux Center, Cherokee, Lake View, Webster City, Marshalltown, Cedar Rapids and Anamosa.

Sound like fun? You can cheer on the team either in person or by donating to the Alumni Endowed Scholarship Fund. Find more information – and follow the team’s daily progress – on the Facebook page for “GU Team Yellowjacket.”
