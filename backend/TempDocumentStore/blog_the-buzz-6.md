HOMETOWN:San Jacinto, CaliforniaCLASS YEAR:2022MAJOR:Master of Science in Nutrition & Human Performance

Talia Martinez, who graduated from Graceland with her Master of Science in Nutrition and Human Performance (MSNHP) in 2022, collaborated with Assistant Professor of Health and Movement Science Melanie Mason, DAT, LAT, ATC, CES, PRES, and Assistant Professor of Allied Health James Geiselman, DC, to publish a review paper in the Nutritional Foundations journal. The paper, titled “Weight Loss Using a Ketogenic Diet for Adults with Type II Diabetes” was part of her thesis project in the MSNHP program. It reviews the differences in weight loss between very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets and diets using normal, smaller reductions in fat intake in adults with Type II Diabetes. Martinez is the first graduate of the new MSNHP program and is setting a tone of excellence.

Out of 11,000 NAIA scholar-athletes, Peyton Anderson received the distinguished A.O. Duer Scholarship Award for the 2021-22 season at the NAIA National Convention held in New Orleans in April 2023. Anderson displays leadership both in sports and academics, and many who nominated him echo the strong character, work ethic, and leadership he has shown in his time at Graceland. This combination of characteristics and respect from his peers allowed Anderson to serve as Cheville House President this past year and be elected to represent the entire student body as Graceland Student Government President for the 2023-24 school year.

Delaney Fox can be seen in all aspects of Graceland’s social life, and after serving as an HP, she has been elected COSA President for the 2023-24 school year. She had not planned on doing anything her senior year, but said, “This year, I have grown so much and been able to create so many relationships with the other house presidents and girls on my house … as I thought about my Graceland Experience and how much fun I had participating in COSA events, it inspired me to create those experiences for others.”

Since Tumisang Leshoeli first arrived, her joy, sincerity, and leadership reverberated throughout campus. This spring, she was elected as Amici House President for the 2023-24 school year. “Leaving my country and coming here, I knew I would experience culture shock. So, I wanted to have an open mind and be open to all the people I would meet. I think it was this mindset that allowed me to connect with others and will help me be a successful HP next year,” said Leshoeli. Some of Leshoeli’s art projects, inspired by her South African culture, were recently highlighted on the Graceland Art Program’s Instagram account.

Millslagle also received male co-athlete of the year from the Association of Student Athletes.
