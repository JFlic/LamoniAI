A commitment to growth, an innovative mindset, and lasting connections — these are the qualities that define Graceland University.

The “Do Good for Graceland” campaign has made significant progress, but there is still more we can accomplish together. This year, we have seen firsthand that doing good for Graceland means creating opportunities for our students — from helping first-generation students seize new opportunities, to enabling legacy families to carry forward cherished traditions, to supporting aspiring leaders as they make meaningful contributions across different industries and communities. Now, we aim to broaden this impact even more: “Do Good for Graceland” means making a positive difference for the world.

Here’s what you can do in 2025 to help bring students to Graceland and send them off into the world prepared to make a difference!

We’ve challenged our board and alumni to help us bring five students each who belong at Graceland. Our goal is to connect 600 future students with campus visits to set a record incoming class for Fall 2025 — but we can’t do it without you! Help us launch even more students on an educational journey that will transform their lives.

While we encourage you to do good in many ways, a financial gift is a powerful way to create opportunities, inspire leaders, and make a lasting impact. Every contribution helps Graceland thrive and empowers our students to change the world.

Did you know Graceland connects current students with alumni through GU4U? This online community provides career advice, networking, resume help, and access to internships and job opportunities, supporting students as they take their next steps as leaders.

Our Alumni Board has various committees, but they all work together to foster close and beneficial relationships throughout the entire Yellowjacket Hive. Want to really lead the way for student and alumni connection?

Whether it’s in class or on the court, your knowledge, expertise, and connection to Graceland can impact a current student. From guest lecturing, being a part of our speaker series, round table events, or supporting one of our teams or clubs, there are countless ways to connect and inspire!

Let us know how you’re interested in helping students across all of our campuses.
