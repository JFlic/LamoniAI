# ACE Program | Graceland

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/academics/ace-program/#top

Graceland University’s ACE Program is an incredible opportunity for high school 11th- and 12th-grade students (and 9th- and 10th-grade talented and gifted students) to earn college credit. The ACE Program operates under Iowa’s Postsecondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) Act, which opens the door to any high school junior or senior with at least a 3.0 GPA or with the recommendation of their high school counselor or principal to enroll in our classes and earn dual credit – three college credits as well as high school credit.

Students may enroll in up to, but not including 12 semester hours (12 s.h. is considered full-time enrollment). Students may not enroll in a course if a comparable course is available at the local school district. Additional classes may be taken but the student will be responsible for payment at normal Graceland cost.

Graceland offers ACE students an exceptional incentive: automatic acceptance into Graceland University and guaranteed up to a 50% tuition scholarship.

Graceland University offers courses in the following formats:

Courses and instructors are to be approved by Graceland if the course is taught by a high school faculty member. In order for Graceland to offer credit for courses taught on location, the courses must also be taught at Graceland. The participating school district will submit the course syllabus and the instructor’s credentials to the Graceland Admissions Office atadmissions@graceland.eduwho will request that the appropriate Graceland department examine the syllabus and instructor’s credentials for approval.

Funding for this program comes from local school districts. If a high school faculty member teaches a course on location, the cost is $90 per student/course. The local school district pays for the instructor’s time, textbooks and other fees.

Courses in the discipline of mathematics, science, social sciences, humanities and courses in career option programs are eligible for students to enroll in under the PSEO Act.

If you would like to enroll one of your students for a face-to-face course at Graceland University under the ACE Program, or if you would like to offer an onsite ACE course at your high school, please use the attached informational brochure/checklist.

The complete list of Graceland Universitymajors and minorswill assist you in choosing courses that fit into your chosen major.

We are excited for this amazing opportunity for high school students to take ACE courses and seek entrance into Graceland University. Please contact us with any questions you may have.
