In the midst of a campus where community is experienced, the president is central to the university’s mission. The role of the Graceland University president is to bring a depth of experience to capitalize fully on the remarkable talent and commitment of Graceland’s staff and faculty with the ultimate goal to connect students to experiences that will deliver successful graduates into the world.

With the announcement of Dr. Patricia H. Draves as Graceland’s 18thpresident, the Board of Trustees affirmed the presence of this ability, and the university is excited to welcome her for her first day in the Office of the President.

Today begins the new president’s responsibility to transcend the leadership team and reach out to the entire Graceland community to ensure achievement is planned, collaborative and celebrated. Her role will include a commitment to the mission and values of Graceland University, grounded in the Christian faith and sponsoring church, Community of Christ.

“I am very excited to begin my new role as Graceland’s next president,” shared Draves. “The Graceland and local communities have proven to be the inclusive and stimulating atmosphere that drew me to seek out this role. I look forward to meeting as many people as possible in the coming months and cannot wait to begin welcoming students as they further their educational journeys at Graceland University.”

Educated as a chemist, Dr. Draves is a strategic thinker and agent of change whose insight and ingenuity have opened the doors to new programs and initiatives throughout her career. She is a creative leader, excited by the academic enterprise and ready to engage, inspire and affirm Graceland faculty, staff and students in building an even stronger and more distinctive university.

As a first-time university president, Dr. Draves brings a fresh perspective with a wealth of knowledge and experience to the Office of the President and to Graceland University, and today marks the beginning of an era filled with optimism and anticipation.
