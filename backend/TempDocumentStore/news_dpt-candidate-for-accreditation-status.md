On December 1, 2023, Graceland University was granted candidacy for itsDoctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) programfrom the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE), which joins other approvals already received by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), the Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas Departments of Higher Education.

“We are really excited about this milestone in our program,” saidLeigh Murray, PT, PhD, Program Director of Graceland’s DPT program. “I am grateful to CAPTE and to the Graceland faculty and staff members who assisted in the accreditation process.”

By achieving candidate for accreditation status, all Graceland DPT enrollees will be able to take the National Physical Therapy Exam (NPTE) for licensure. The USDE has ruled degrees earned and issued by an institution or program holding candidate status from a nationally recognized agency are considered to be from an accredited institution or program.

Graceland University’s DPT is a two-year hybrid, accelerated physical therapy program providing students with an innovative and collaborative learning community. The program’s mission is to develop movement system experts who lead and serve their communities with justice, compassion, excellence, and a sense of belonging. The curriculum develops an adaptable, collaborative, evidence-informed, socially responsible, and reflective learning community of physical therapists.

Graceland Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of FacultyJoel Shrock, PhD, said, “I commend the DPT team for crossing this milestone. Graceland looks forward to welcoming its first cohort of students in January 2024.”

The deadline to apply for the January 2024 cohort is December 15, 2023.Information on Graceland’s Doctor of Physical Therapy program is available atwww.graceland.edu/dpt.

If needing to contact the program/institution directly, please call 816-209-1332 or emaildpt-admissions@graceland.edu.
