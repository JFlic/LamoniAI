Graceland University partners with Southwestern Community College (SWCC) to create an articulation agreement to ease the transfer process into the Graceland UniversityAllied Health program.

Health and Movement Science Department ChairMelanie Mason, DAT, worked in partnership with Registrar Peggy Mothershead and an SWCC representative to create a more effortless transfer experience from SWCC into the Graceland University Allied Health program.

Traditionally, the transfer process can be complicated as students navigate multiple variables, including transferring their previous courses, what classes to take next, and when they will be able to graduate. The articulation agreement solves all those challenges. Students with an associate degree with a transfer major in Exercise Science from SWCC are guaranteed their courses will transfer to the Allied Health program, they will arrive knowing exactly which courses they need to enroll in next, and they are set up to graduate in four years.

“We are excited for the opportunity to welcome SWCC students into our Allied Health program, where they can go on to enjoy many of the career and learning opportunities we offer with a Graceland degree,” said Mason.

This commitment to smoothing the transfer process demonstrates both institutions’ commitment to increasing opportunities for student access and success in higher education.
