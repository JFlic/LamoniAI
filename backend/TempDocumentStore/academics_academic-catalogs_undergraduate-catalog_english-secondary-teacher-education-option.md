Survey of American Literature stretching from the advent of European colonization in the Western Hemisphere to the present. The course will pay special attention to the legacies of colonialism and slavery, the history of social movements for freedom and equality, the making (and unmaking) of U.S. national mythologies, the major formal transformations that have taken place in U.S. Literature, and the function of literature as an innovative and adaptive technology that expands human capacities.

The course employs visual and literary texts to examine the various social, cultural, political, artistic, and philosophical movements from modernity to the present. By critically engaging with both colonial and postcolonial texts, the course attempts to understand the ways in which the concepts like modernity, empire, coloniality, postcoloniality, and world-building intersect as well as shape our contemporary world.
