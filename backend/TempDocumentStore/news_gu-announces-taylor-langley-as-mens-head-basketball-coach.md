Graceland University is happy to announce that it has hired Taylor Langley as its head men’s basketball coach. Langley joins Graceland from the NAIA’s University of Michigan-Dearborn and brings with him extensive post-season experience. Langley’s team competed in the 2017-18 national tournament that Graceland won in overtime on a last-second shot.

Athletic director Brady McKillip said, “We are thrilled to have Taylor join the Graceland community. He brings with him a great energy and work ethic.”

“I am thrilled to be joining the Graceland University community. Upon my visit, I felt an instant connection with the campus,” said Langley. “I could feel the genuine student-centered mission of the university and wanted to be part of it. I am excited to get to work with my staff serving student-athletes while striving to build a top-tier basketball program in the NAIA.”

Prior to joining UM-Dearborn, Langley served as an assistant coach at Davenport University, also a member of the WHAC. The Panthers were 117-25 in the four years Langley was on the staff at DU, with three trips to the NAIA quarterfinals and one to the national semifinal. He helped recruit 11 NAIA All-Americans, one national player of the year and a Bevo Francis Award winner.

Langley played his college basketball at Macomb College, where he started as a walk-on and finished his career with a scholarship and was named a team captain.

Graceland President Patricia H. Draves said, “I can’t wait to watch Coach Langley’s first game in the newly renovated Morden Center. He is a great fit for Graceland and we’re excited to have him on campus.”

Langley is excited to compete in the newly renovated Morden Center in the fall. “My hope is that the Morden Center continues to be a special place for Graceland students, staff, alumni, and the Lamoni community. The men’s basketball program will work tirelessly to ensure we honor the extremely generous donation through the level of excellence we display on and off the court.”
