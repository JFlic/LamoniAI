Graceland University is among a group of Council of Independent Colleges (CIC) member institutions selected to send representatives to the second annual Diversity, Civility, and the Liberal Arts Institute in June.

Read the press release below by Laura Wilcox from the CIC for more details on this distinction:

“CIC Selects Participating Institutions for Diversity, Civility, and the Liberal Arts Institute”

(WASHINGTON, DC)Twenty-five CIC member institutions have been selected to participate in the second annual Diversity, Civility, and the Liberal Arts Institute, to be held in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 2–5, 2019. Each institution will send a team of two faculty leaders and two senior administrators. The Institute is designed to help faculty members and administrators address issues of diversity, civility, inclusion and student unrest on campus more effectively.

The Institute is directed by Beverly Daniel Tatum, president emerita of Spelman College and a leading scholar of race and higher education. During the Institute, prominent humanities and social science scholars will present key research and recent developments in their fields and apply these concepts to understanding student concerns and deepening the educational experience. The goal is to encourage thoughtful campus discussions that engage students’ minds and their emotions.

Each participating college will develop plans to incorporate the Institute content into specific courses, advising and counseling services, and co-curricular activities at their institutions. Debbie Cottrell, vice president for academic affairs at Texas Lutheran University, which participated in 2018’s inaugural Institute, says that “our experience was so helpful…. We are committed to continuing and expanding the initiatives we identified as priorities as part of the Institute, and we are hopeful about the larger impact it will have on our campus.”

Participants for the 2019 Institute were selected through a highly competitive application process. According to CIC President Richard Ekman, “the volume, quality and urgency of the proposals reflect the commitment of independent colleges and universities to promoting diversity and civility, not just on their campuses but across the nation.”

The Institute is supported by a generous grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

Participating Institutions:
