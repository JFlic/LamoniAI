July 29, 2015

Graceland University awarded $142,000 in scholarships to campers at Spectacular (Spec) last week. During Spec, over 1,000 campers and their leaders gather at Graceland University for the largest annual gathering of youth in Community of Christ, Graceland’s sponsoring church. All campers will have opportunities to participate in leadership and discipleship development, diverse worship and expression of arts, music and sports.

The scholarships given at Spec are announced at the end of the week-long camp and are available to students entering their senior year of high school and participating in Spec.

The Spectacular Vision Scholarship is designed to recognize youth with a vision of how Community of Christ can best live out its mission, and how they are part of making that vision a reality. Graceland will present three scholarships, which are renewable for up to four years. These scholarships are awarded in the amounts of $2,000 for first place, $1,500 for second place and $1,000 for third place.

Graceland presented Wallace B. Smith grants to several outstanding students at Spec with plans to attend Graceland University upon graduation from high school. These grants include an Honor Grant of $3,000, and one grant each of $2,500 for first place, $2,000 for second place, $1,500 for third place and $1,000 for honorable mention. These grants are renewable for up to four years.

Thomas Cochran Memorial Volleyball Scholarship is given to volleyball players who are selected by the Graceland University coaching staff. Tier one winners receive $1,500 renewable for four years, totaling $6,000, and tier two winners receive $2,000 renewable for four years, totaling $8,000.

College can be very expensive. In addition to the scholarships listed above — specifically available to Spec participants — Graceland has established several scholarships to help with the cost of earning a college degree and getting the “Graceland Experience.” Contact the Admissions Office or visit our website at www.graceland.edu for more information on what scholarships or grants are available to you.
