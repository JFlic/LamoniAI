# Chemistry Degree

In addition to the general education requirements (some are listed below with *), majors in Chemistry must complete the following 51 semester hours:

In addition to the Chemistry course requirements, the following courses are also required for majors in Chemistry:

A study of the various patterns and mechanisms of heredity, changes in the genetic material and the consequences of these genetic changes. The course will also give an introduction to cellular structures, macromolecules, and processes, including DNA replication, transcription, translation and cellular signaling. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: CHEM1330, CHEM3410, or (CHEM1410 and CHEM1450). (C or better strongly recommended).

General Chemistry I Workshop is appropriate for any student interested in developing a strong background in chemistry. It is intended to be the first university chemistry course for science majors. As such, it will be fairly rigorous and will draw upon previous experience in mathematics and science.

- CHEM1420General Chemistry II Workshop with LabCHEM1420General Chemistry II Workshop with Lab  - 4 s.h.General Chemistry II Workshop is appropriate for any student interested in developing a strong background in chemistry. It is the continuation of CHEM1430. Students will gain a deeper understanding of basic chemical principles and will emphasize problem solving. It is fairly rigorous and will draw upon previous chemistry experience as well as mathematics and other science fields. Major areas to be covered include physical properties of solids, liquids, and solutions, intermolecular forces, energy changes in chemical reactions, thermodynamics, gas-phase equilibrium, and aqueous acid/base equilibrium. Laboratory activities and experiments are closely related to concepts introduced in class discussions and will allow students to develop their laboratory skills. Good safety practices and experimental record keeping will be stressed. Students are expected to actively participate in class activities and discussions in addition to homework assignments, individual/group study and preparation for exams. Prerequisite: CHEM1410.
