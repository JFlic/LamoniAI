Graceland University and Cleveland University-Kansas City combine their expertise in a new dual degree offering.

January 17, 2025 | jns

Last summer, Associate Professor of Allied HealthJames Geiselman, DC, andRobert Davidson, PhD,Director of Graceland University’s Master of Science in Nutrition and Human Performance Program, had an idea. They reached out to Diane Bartholomew, DHSc, former Chair of theHealth and Movement Science departmentat Graceland, and now Vice President of Academic Affairs at Cleveland University-Kansas City (CUKC).

Within a matter of months, both sides quickly turned a promising articulation agreement opportunity into a great opportunity for both Graceland University and students pursuing theDoctor of Chiropractic degree at CUKC: a 3+1 dual degree program leading toward a Doctor of Chiropractic/Master of Science in Nutrition and Human Performance.

Students in the CUKC Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) program who are also interested in pursuing aMaster of Science in Nutrition and Human Performancecan now participate in the 3+1 program and choose between aSport Nutrition and Performanceand aHealth and Wellness Promotionconcentration.

The partnership makes all the difference for students not only in reducing the time and cost involved in earning the degrees, but insynergizing the strengths of both programs: a robust foundation in nutrition and human performance from Graceland, and a whole-person approach to chiropractic from CUKC.A dual degree expands their range of career motion: graduates extend their professional skills, resources, networks, and job prospects.

All to the benefit of their future patients and clients:“Chiropractors are uniquely situated to provide patients with personalized care,”Davidson explains one of the motivators to initiate the partnership with the CUKC College of Chiropractic. “The combination with Graceland University’s MS Degree in Nutrition and Human Performance equips students with specialized training that can help boost professional success through enhanced patient outcomes.”

“I understand first-hand the value of having both an MS in Nutrition and Human Performance and a Doctor of Chiropractic degree in one’s career,” says Geiselman, a seasoned chiropractor himself.“I enjoyed the process of putting the existing relationship between our institutions to work and collaborating to make this added value possible for students in the CUKC D.C. program.”

“Expanding educational offerings for CUKC students is an ongoing priority in support of our mission to educate and develop leaders in health promotion,” Bartholomew says. “This agreement with Graceland University contributes to that goal, and promotes continued learning aimed at providing the best patient care possible.”

The teams of the Graceland University Division of Health and Movement Science and Cleveland University-Kansas City College of Chiropractic look forward to welcoming the first cohort in the dual degree program.
