# Bachelor of Science in Data Science | Graceland University

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/science-math/data-science#top

With a data science degree from Graceland University, you’ll use statistics, scientific computing, and other scientific processes and methods to understand data and find answers in a digital world.

A data science degree from an institution based on the liberal education tradition offers a breadth of knowledge needed to approach and solve complex problems. This emerging field did not exist 10 years ago and is evolving rapidly with the exponential increase of data from online, social media, and the expanding Web of Things. It is an area in which many disciplines and backgrounds participate. Industries that offer data science careers include healthcare, finance, marketing, and technology, among others.A critical need exists for data scientists who can collect and identify key data, analyze that data using appropriate methods, and draw sound conclusions that inform the decision-making process. Students receive experiential learning paired with data science courses that integrate data analysis and decision-making throughout the curriculum.

- Data Science CertificatesData analytics certificates are designed to equip students with:the tools necessary to use and understand common data analysis techniques,to understand the proper use of, and potential misuse of, data and analytics methods as a means of democratizing analytics,increase the understanding of, and proficiency in, the use and application of analysis techniques in a chosen domain.Data analytics certificates are broken down into three levels:Introductory Levelprovides students with an understanding of the steps in the data analytics process necessary to take data to information to insight. At this level, students are introduced to the concepts of exploratory data analysis, how to use commonly available computer codes that execute ML and regression methods, learning the strengths and weaknesses of each.  Students will also be introduced to the basic principles of coding and databases in addition to the ethical use of dataDomain Levelprovides students with experience in using the data science process and its robust tools to analyze and solve. problems in a specific content area.Capstone Levelis for students to conduct a full data analytics project complete with problem definition, analysis, and dissemination. The project will be completed in conjunction with Community Partners that include Graceland, the local Iowa community, Graceland alums and their employers, and Graceland’s wholly owned subsidiary, SkillPath. Each project will be conducted by 2-3 students, a faculty member who serves as the Capstone Leader, and a Community Partner. Smaller and larger teams will be permitted depending on the nature of the project.Students can select from the followingdomain specific certificates:Agricultural BusinessBusiness ManagementChemistryEconomicsEnvironmental ScienceMarketingSport ManagementA minor in Data Sciencerequires 20 semester hoursas described below:CSIT1100 Principles of Computing (Python Programming)– 3 s.h.CSIT1200 Data Structures and Algorithms– 3 s.h.DSCI1500 Principles of Data Science and Analytics– 3 s.h.MATH1370 Statistics for Sciences– 3 s.h.MATH1510 Calculus I– 4 s.h.MATH1520 Calculus II– 4 s.h.
