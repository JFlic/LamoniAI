Jeanne Sundell ’81 Davispassed away Jan. 1, 2019. Survived by her husband, Paul ’81, and their children Mike ’10, Jacob ’12 and Julie ’15, Jeanne was devoted to her family, yet she made time to pursue her many talents in opera, watercolor, ceramics, guitar, piano and volunteering at church in her role as a High Priest. She moved with her family several times over the years, finally settling in Lamoni, and in each location, Jeanne discovered new friends and shared her many talents through relationships with her community and church family.

For many years, Jeanne worked as a professional artist with both watercolor and oil paintings, showing in galleries along the coast of California and Washington. Jeanne also worked for Community of Christ International Headquarters as a Worship Specialist and at Graceland University as Director of Communications, from where she retired in August 2018.

In her role as Graceland’s director of communications, Jeanne gave her talents over the past five years as editor of this very magazine. She told the story of Graceland through the individuals who embody it, and she captured our interest and our hearts. She is missed every day, as our editor and our friend.
