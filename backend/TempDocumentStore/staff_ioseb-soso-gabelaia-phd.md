Dr. Gabelaia is an educator who believes in mentoring students to achieve their goals and allows them to keep learning and grow in knowledge. Hence, sharing international professional experiences from business fields such as marketing, management, and communications, with Graceland students will be an honor.

Digital transformation, artificial intelligence, and innovations are a massive part of the business. Therefore, applying design thinking, six sigma, and scrum processes have been vital for professional development and research.

Lived experience has a significant value. Students need a voice to express themselves while also receiving constructive feedback. It enables students to think free and highlight their uniqueness. Teaching philosophy is based on sustainable development. Students must acquire new knowledge and skills necessary to shape a sustainable future. Students must have a vibrant classroom environment where they can take responsibility for their actions, which encourages and empowers student learning.
