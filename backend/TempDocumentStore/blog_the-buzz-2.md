This year’s medals were presented before kickoff at the homecoming football game. A special plaque with the student’s name will be placed in their coach’s office to commemorate the students’ achievements, and as a reminder of the important role a coach plays in a student’s collegiate life.

Theatre Production Addresses Global Issue

Jessie Fuller ’20 enacted the scene from “Canary” by Hanna Cormick, a poetic piece dedicated to those who put their life/body on the line, voluntarily and involuntarily, to bring about awareness of climate change, like canaries in the coal mine. Assistant Professor of Theatre Tracy Salter dedicated this scene to her friend and former professor who suffers from multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). Susceptible to environmental toxins, individuals with MCS are characterized as canaries because their bodies can no longer process certain poisons in the air, water or food sources, and are early indicators of a danger.

“LIGHTING THE WAY”presented Graceland’s theatre audience with different perspectives on climate change through 12 short vignettes — some silly and some intense, but all thought-provoking. The Graceland performance was part of a global network of public forums on the subject of climate change under the umbrella of The Arctic Cycle consortium. The Climate Change Theatre Action, a participating group, offers a menu of 50 short scenes for stage performance. Of those, Graceland chose 12 for the local production. This scene, “Canary,” was selected to be performed at the annual Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival Region 5, held in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Jan. 19-25, 2020.

Fly Like a Bird

In November,JANA ZINSER ’80 SHARED A LIVE READING OF HER LATEST NOVEL, inspired by her experiences growing up in Lamoni. Fly Like A Bird, Zinser’s second novel, tells the coming-of-age story of Ivy, a young girl growing up in a small southern Iowa town during the 1970s, where everyone knows everything about their quirky neighbors. After discovering that her family and neighbors are keeping secrets from her about the night a tragic car crash killed her parents, Ivy attempts to untangle the truth about what really happened and escape the town that lied to her about the true fate of her mother. The reading, followed by a question-and answer session, took place in the Frederick Madison Smith Library on the Lamoni campus.
