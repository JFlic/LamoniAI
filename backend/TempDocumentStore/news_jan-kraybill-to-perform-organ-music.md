LAMONI, IOWA (January 16, 2013)—To celebrate the renovation of the Shaw Center and the re-installation of the Casavant pipe organ, the Graceland Music Department presents a free organ recital by Dr. Jan Kraybill on Friday, Feb. 15, 2013, at 7:30 p.m. The recital will be held in the Shaw Center Family Auditorium at Graceland University. This free concert will explore multiple genres of organ music.

Aptly named “one of the jewels of the Kansas City music scene” by the Kansas City’s Online Journal of the Performing Arts, Kraybill is the principal organist at Community of Christ International Headquarters and conservator of the Julia Irene Kauffman Casavant at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City, Mo.

Kraybill’s sparkling personality and remarkable music are sure to be a crowd pleaser. With a more informal toned performance, Kraybill successfully entertains a wide range of audiences, children included. During her career and to this day, she has performed as both a pianist and organist at a number of venues throughout the United States as well as Canada, Germany, Poland, Russia, South Korea, and Tahiti, and held multiple tours of the United Kingdom.

Paul Horsely, from Kansas City’s The Independent, comments on his personal experience with one of Kraybill’s performances: “Jan Kraybill demonstrated her extraordinary virtuosity at the keyboard in four chorales and, most famously, the “St. Anne” Fugue. She began the latter at a tempo that seemed downright suicidal, but managed to hack through the thickets of one of Bach’s most complex works with nary a hitch. Her remarkable feat brought the audience to its collective feet.”

Known for her infectious character and inspiring passion for music, Kraybill never disappoints. In addition to her solo performances, Kraybill has played with a number of other performers over her career, including the acclaimed Baroque group the Bach Aria Soloists, the Kansas City Symphony and the Grammy-winning Kansas City Chorale.

Dr. Kraybill was awarded the highest level of certification by the American Guild of Organists, the Fellowship (FAGO) certification, back in 2010. She holds Bachelor of Music Education and Master of Music (piano performance) from Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS, and Doctor of Musical Arts (organ performance) from the University of Missouri-Kansas City Conservatory of Music in Kansas City, MO.
