On April 1, Graceland Yellowjacket Peyton Anderson ’24 traveled to New Orleans, La. to receive the esteemed A.O. Duer Scholarship award for the 2021-2022 season at the NAIA National Convention.

Named in honor of the NAIA’s former executive secretary who served the association for 26 years, the A.O. Duer Scholarship Award has been annually presented since 1967 to a male and female junior student-athlete in any sport who has excelled in scholarship, character, and citizenship.

Anderson is a track and field student-athlete for Graceland University from Lee’s Summit, Mo. He displays leadership both in his sports and academics, and many who nominated Peyton echo the strong character, incredible work ethic, and leadership he has displayed in his short time at Graceland.

Anderson has continually challenged himself academically by taking a full course load, maintaining a perfect 4.0 GPA while working on a major in Economics, with minors in both Data Science and Sport Management. Peyton is involved in house leadership roles, helps tutor students on campus, and continues to be incredibly committed to both his studies and his athletic career.

“Peyton is an exceptional student both on and off of the track. We are proud to have him as a part of our community, and I look forward to seeing him continue his excellent work next year,” said Graceland President Patricia H. Draves.

It is this combination of work ethic, leadership ability, and respect from his peers that allowed Anderson to serve as Cheville house president this past year and to be elected to represent the entire student body as Graceland Student Government president for the 2023-2024 school year.
