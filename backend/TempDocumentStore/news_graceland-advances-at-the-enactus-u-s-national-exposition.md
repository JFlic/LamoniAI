Graceland University Enactus will advance to the second round of competition after making their way into the top 16 teams in the country Monday. The decision was announced to a crowd of students and supporters anticipating the results after a day of competition at the Kansas City Convention Center.

Graceland’s presentation team – made up of students Alyssa Dockins, Melissa Sherer, Regan Jackson, Robbie Turk, Sydney Dorrance and Zack Ferrara – out-presented the four other universities in their league – Southern Adventist University, Cornerstone University, Southwestern College–Kansas and Penn State University Park – and answered all questions from the judges in a way that enhanced their presentation even further as they delivered the same passion in their words as they feel for the projects they were there to represent.

“I am so proud to have been a member of the Graceland Enactus team throughout my time at Graceland,” shared Melissa Sherer ’18. “Our authentic passion for our community and project is an inspiration to me in my life, and I cannot wait to see how far it takes us!”

This level of success is not new for Graceland Enactus. The 2006 Graceland team took the number-one spot in the nation and finished second in the world behind only China at the World Cup in Paris, France, that year. Each year since then, Graceland has made their way to the U.S. national competition and to the top 16 for the second round of competition nearly each one of those.

“I could not be more proud of our Enactus students,” expressed Jared Doty, Director of the Graceland University Sandage Center for the Study of Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship. “They did an outstanding job representing Graceland, and their success is well deserved. I am humbled that I am fortunate enough to work with these amazing students and am privileged to represent Graceland University.”

Continuing in the tradition of success, Graceland University Enactus will deliver their presentation to another panel of judges Tuesday against the three other top-16 schools in league four (Canisius College, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Utah Valley University), in the third timeslot at 9:30 a.m., a selection made by presenter Melissa Sherer.
