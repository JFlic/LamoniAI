## Graceland University Policy and Procedure

SUBJECT:  Privacy, Disclosure and Access to Student Records.

PURPOSE:  To comply with the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and to delineate Graceland University’s (Graceland) policy for disclosure of, and access to, educational records.

DEFINITIONS:

Directory Information:  Graceland designates the following as directory information: name, local and home address, local and home telephone number, e-mail address, date and place of birth, major field of study, class level, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards earned, most recent previous school attended, and photograph. Graceland may disclose any of the above directory information without prior consent, unless notified in writing by the student to the contrary prior to the start of classes each period of enrollment. Such writing should be delivered to the Office of Residence Life.

Education records:  any record (in handwriting, print, film, tapes, video, or other medium) maintained by Graceland or an agent of Graceland, which is directly related to a student, except the following:

Graceland Official: A person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, support staff or student worker position; person elected to the Board of Trustees; a person employed by or retained by Graceland to perform a special task, such as an attorney or auditor; employees or students appointed to official Graceland committees.

Designated Records Custodians: The following positions are the designated record custodians and only those custodians should release the types of data listed in the first column:

POLICY:

Access of Education Records

In accordance with Section 99.7 of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations to provide annual notification of students’ FERPA rights, Graceland University includes such notification in the student handbook.

Student’s inspection of education records: Students may inspect and review their education records upon request to the appropriate record custodian. Students may be required to complete a written request identifying as precisely as possible the record or records he or she wishes to inspect. The record custodian will make the needed arrangements for access as promptly as possible and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. Graceland will provide the copy as expeditiously as possible, but no later than 45 days from the receipt of the request. When a record contains information about more than one student, the student may inspect and review only the records which relate to him/her. If multiple students are referenced within a record, the record custodian will redact names and any identifying phrases.

Right of refusal to inspect records: Graceland reserves the right to refuse to permit a student to inspect the following records:

Right to deny transcripts and copies of records: Graceland reserves the right to deny transcripts or copies of records not required to be made available by the FERPA in any of the following situations:

Fee for copies: The standard fee for copies will apply for any records made available in accordance with this policy.

Disclosure of Education Records

Directory information may be disclosed without prior consent of the student unless Graceland is notified in writing to the contrary prior to the start of classes.

Graceland will disclose information from a student’s educational records only with written consent of the student, except the following:

Record of requests for disclosure:  Graceland will maintain a record of all requests for and/or disclosure of non-directory information from a student’s education records, other than a Graceland official with a legitimate educational interest. The record will indicate the name of the party making the request, any additional party to whom it may be redisclosed, and the legitimate interest the party had in requesting or obtaining the information. The record may be reviewed by the student, and/or parents of the student if the parents claim the student as a dependent for income tax purposes.

Correction Of Education Records

Student’s right to request correction of records: Students have the right to request corrections of records they believe are inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of their privacy rights. Following are the procedures for the correction of records:

A student’s request to amend a record must be directed to the designated record custodian (see the record custodian listing above). The student must identify the part of the record to be changed and specify why the information is inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student’s privacy or other rights. If the record custodian agrees with the request, the record will be changed.

If the record custodian believes that the information presented does not merit a change, the student will be notified of that decision and advised of the hearing process. If a hearing is requested the following steps will be followed:

PROCEDURE:In accordance with FERPA, academic information about a student will not be released unless written authorization is given by the student. However, Graceland officials may use discretion to release directory information (defined above) unless the student specifically requests otherwise following the process set forth above.
