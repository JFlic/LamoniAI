We are pleased that you’re including Graceland in your search. As you explore our website, you’ll learn about coming to Graceland as a transfer or non-traditional college student and the unique services we provide to ease your transition to Graceland University.

We hope the information below answers the majority of your questions. If you have other questions or need additional information, please contactAdmissions.We are happy to assist you.

JUMP TO

To apply as a transfer student to Graceland you must have:

You will also need to submit the following items:

Transfer students, including community and junior college transfers, who have earned 56 transferable semester hours with a grade point average of 2.00 based on a 4.00 point system, if accepted, will enter Graceland at junior standing.

Courses accepted for transfer will be accepted as credit only and will not carry grade points. Credit will be accepted for courses in which the student earned a grade of D- or better.

Credit or waiver through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and Advanced Placement (AP) will be determined by Graceland upon receipt of the scores from the College Board and will not necessarily correspond with what the previous school may have awarded.

Making College Affordable

Graceland is much more affordable than most people think – in fact, our published tuition is the best amongst all private colleges in Iowa. And when combined with our easy to understand scholarships, our cost of attendance is often more accessible than a public school.

Transfer student tuition and fees depends primarily on which program you’re applying for and whether or not you’ll be receiving any financial aid or scholarships. Learn more about our costs and use our tuition calculator for a better estimate.

We work hard to keep Graceland affordable for everyone. No matter where you studied before, we encourage you to learn about and apply for our many scholarships, grants and financial aid options.

Let’s Talk LogisticsReady to get started on transferring to Graceland? Here’s what you need to do.

Whether you’re transferring from another college or applying to Graceland after a lengthy absence from school, the following information will give you the basic information you need to make an easy transition.

Note that a course will only have a Graceland equivalent if an official evaluation has been completed by the university. If your course has no equivalent, please contact Admissions to request a review.

Example: If you have earned 56 transferable semester hours with a grade point average of 2.00 based on a 4.00 point system, you will enter Graceland at junior standing.

Note: The information within the evaluation system is provided as a guide only. We provide no guarantee that a particular course from your current or former institution will be accepted for transfer credit. An official evaluation of transfer credit will be done upon acceptance to Graceland University. Our evaluation system is subject to frequent revisions, and equivalents may change. We will be adding schools and additional courses to the list on a regular basis.

The Graceland University Admissions and Advising Partnership programs (AAP) help students from Indian Hills Community College (IHCC) and Southwestern Community College (SWCC) smoothly transfer to Graceland. Students benefit from academic advising and a shared experience with the university prior to transferring. Graceland assists each student in planning their academic program at IHCC/SWCC and Graceland to attain a BA, BS or BSN degree in a timely manner.Eligibility Criteria for the AAP
