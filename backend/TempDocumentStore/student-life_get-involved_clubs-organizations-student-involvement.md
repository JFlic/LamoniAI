Save Your Spot for Fall 2025 on the Lamoni Campus

Graceland University has over 30 clubs and organizations for students. There’s something for everyone! Did you know belonging to something significant and worthwhile is a key component to satisfaction in college? Clubs and organizations are primarily student initiated and student-driven. It is very possible that if you have a special interest, there is already a club or organization devoted to that area.

Interested in starting a group? Simply find a sponsor and contact the Student Activities office. The Council of Student Life Committee meets weekly to approvecharters.

*Note on reading: the sponsor is listed after the club or organization’s name.
