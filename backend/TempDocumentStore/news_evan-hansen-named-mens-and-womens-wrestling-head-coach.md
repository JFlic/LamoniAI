Graceland University is proud to announce the promotion of Evan Hansen to Head Coach of the Men’s and Women’s Wrestling programs. Hansen, a four-time NAIA National Champion and seasoned coach, brings a wealth of experience and passion to the role as he continues to build on the university’s tradition of excellence in wrestling.

Hansen has an impressive track record as both a competitor and a coach. As an assistant coach at Avila University, he played a pivotal role in establishing and growing both the men’s and women’s wrestling programs, including six national qualifying women wrestlers. His extensive experience also includes coaching at AHSTW High School and coaching eight national qualifiers Ottawa University, where he has developed successful athletes and programs. Hansen earned numerous accolades during his time as a wrestler at Grand View University, including NAIA Outstanding Wrestler honors in 2018 and multiple Junior World Team Trials qualifications.

“I’m incredibly grateful for this opportunity to lead Graceland’s wrestling program,” said Hansen. “I’ve been passionate about this sport my entire life, and I’m excited to develop a competitive, disciplined, and high-achieving team. Graceland has a strong wrestling tradition, and I look forward to continuing to build on that success.”

Athletic Director Brady McKillip expressed confidence in Hansen’s ability to lead the program. “Evan’s experience as both a coach and competitor makes him the perfect fit to guide our men’s and women’s wrestling teams into the future. His leadership and commitment to excellence align with Graceland’s values, and we’re excited to see him take our program to the next level.”

Hansen begins as women’s head wrestling coach immediately and will begin as men’s head wrestling coach on April 1. He will be supported by assistant coaches for both the men’s and women’s teams, as well as graduate assistant coaches. His leadership will ensure continued success and development for Graceland’s wrestlers, both athletically and academically.

Zack Mullins will now serve the program as Director of Wrestling while also maintaining his role as Executive Director ofAdmissions. As part of a restructure of Graceland’s admissions approach Mullins was promoted to Executive Director of Admissions in September and continued to coach the Graceland men’s wrestling team to national success this season. Mullins has been instrumental in building a strong foundation, culture, and tradition over the past 12 years, coaching two national champions, 10 All-Americans, and 41 national qualifiers. Under his leadership, the program also excelled academically, earning a combined 50 NWCA/Daktronics Scholar-Athlete awards while finishing in the Top 5 for team GPA three times, including a first-place finish in 2021. The program earned multiple conference accolades, including three Conference Coach of the Year awards (2019, 2020, 2024) and the 2024 Conference Sportsmanship Team Award. Mullins will now turn his full-time focus to his role as Executive Director of Admissions while providing Hansen and Graceland Wrestling oversight, mentoring, and support towards continued national success as the Director of Wrestling.

“We are fortunate to have both Evan and Zack continuing to lead our wrestling programs,” said Graceland University President Joel Shrock. “Zack’s continued involvement as Director of Wrestling ensures strong leadership and stability, while Evan brings new energy and extensive expertise as head coach. This is an exciting time for Graceland Wrestling.”

Graceland University looks forward to the continued success of its wrestling programs under Hansen’s leadership. Mullins, in his director role, will provide oversight and guidance. Together, they will uphold Graceland Wrestling’s rich tradition while striving for new achievements on and off the mat.
