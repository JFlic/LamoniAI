I started my lecturing activities after obtaining a master’s degree in 2013. At Fenix Technical School I was responsible for seven disciplines in the technical courses of Nursing, Radiology, and Work Environment Safety. Further, I could develop my teaching abilities during the PhD and postdoctoral periods at Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos, where I could successfully support undergraduate students and lead classes.

During my professional journey I developed valuable skills in and handling deadly pathogens, molecular biology, and bioinformatics applied to diagnosis of viral infections in a biosafety level-2 environment. During the past few years, I dedicated efforts on the study of the microbiome associated with Brazilian medicinal plants and its potential to tackle multi-resistant pathogens. This project allowed me to develop part of my doctoral studies at Life Sciences Institute of University of Michigan, where I gained major experience and visibility in Microbiology and Natural products.

In my most recent career experience, I can say that I had the privilege to serve the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a postdoctoral researcher at University of Michigan, I participated in the wastewater based epidemiology project which aims efforts on monitoring SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory viruses in wastewater systems.
