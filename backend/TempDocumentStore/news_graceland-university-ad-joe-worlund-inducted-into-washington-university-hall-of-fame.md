Graceland University Director of Athletics, Joe Worlund ’80, is a winner. On and off the field, Worlund has exemplified what it means to be an excellent leader and mentor for aspiring individuals, and to help push themselves to the very best of their potential.

Due to Worlund’s genuine dedication to his profession as an athletic administrator and assistant coach at Washington University in St. Louis, he will be inducted into the WU Sports Hall of Fame on Feb. 20. Graceland University is proud to announce and recognize the induction of such an outstanding individual, who has gone above and beyond to guide young athletes to successful accomplishments.

Joe Worlund spent more than 30 years in various roles of the athletic department at Washington University in St. Louis. He began his tenure in 1982 as the Director of Intramural and Club Sports, a position he held for 16 years before becoming the Assistant Director of Athletics. Worlund was promoted to Associate Director of Athletics July 1, 2010.

In addition to his dedication to Washington University Athletics as an administrator, Worlund spent 12 seasons as an assistant volleyball coach, earning seven NCAA Division III national championships, including six in a row from 1991-96. The program produced eight NCAA Division III Players of the Year and 36 All-Americans during Worlund’s tenure. Worlund received UAA Coaching Staff of the Year honors 10 times.

“I am humbled and honored to return to WU and share the moment with family and friends,” said Worlund.

Worlund’s recent appointment as Graceland University’s Director of Athletics will further his constructive guidance and winning record with athletes here on “the Hill.” “Joe brings a wealth of experience working with athletes and coaches. Graceland is fortunate to have his insight and fresh perspective to lead our athletic department,” noted Vice President of Enrollment at Graceland University, Kirk Bjorland.
