Completed a degree program? Published a written work? Received that awesome promotion? Earned a prestigious honor? If so, we want to hear about it.Share your memories and milestones here.

66 Sally Hutchcroft Meams,received the Lorraine Dambruso Award for Meritorious Service to the Profession at the Californian Language Teachers Association annual meeting in February 2021. She is currently the Site Manager for the Stanford World Language Project in the Graduate School of Education.

67 Marian Matthews Clark,Iowa City, Iowa, recently published These Doors: a Novel which is set in the woods of Oregon. She received her MFA from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop in 1987 and has been working on this book ever since. Though she’s lived in Iowa for 50 years, she considers herself a dual citizen of Iowa and Oregon (which still holds a place in her heart).

69 Jim Barker,Keaau, Hawaii, published his book Flapjacks and Fish Sauce: Asymmetrical Vietnam Humor, a compilation of stories from veterans who served in Vietnamduring the war. After graduating from Graceland, he served in Vietnam from 1971-72 as an adviser and linguist with the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) in II Corps.

Barker also authored an article published August 2021 in Vietnam magazine and online (historynet.com), which documents his involvement in the 1984 triathlon from Long Beach, California, to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., to honor the fallen of the Vietnam War. The article brings to light the vision and goal of Jim and three other veterans (including Jim’s twin brother Ron Barker ’69) who swam, ran, and biked from coast to coast as a way to remind Americans of the gallantry and sacrifice of service members who were in Vietnam, to raise awareness of the efforts of locating the 2,500 MIA Americans, and strengthen the bonds with South Vietnamese refugees who fought with the U.S. in the war.

70 Rod Dixen,Steeleville, Missouri, is a legendary Graceland student, having been enrolled in classes dating back to 1966 and appearing to take tests throughout the years, despite only being seen in the Acacia on a few occasions.*Dixen was so elusive that the true spelling of his name (Dixen, not Dixon) was not discovered until after the magazine went to print – the error appears in the print version of this issue.*

75 Mary Ellen Foss Kimball, Osceola, Iowa, was presented the Governor’s Arts Legacy Award on Aug. 14, 2020, by the Iowa Arts Council for her lifetime support of the arts.

92 Mark Hanton, EdS, has become a businessman in his spare time after he patented his mustard and honey sauce, Hantoon’s Munny. This recipe has origins from his days at Graceland. After sharing it with people he knew and receiving encouragement, he decided to try and make business out of it. He has been fine-tuning the recipe over the years, and now has quite a local following in Michigan with his product available in over 12 stores and online.

97 Josh Ganson,Nixa, Missouri, is Director of Operations for HappyFeet and Legends Soccer, a company that focuses on teaching and coaching youth soccer skills in Springfield, Missouri.

01 Matt Koehn-Fairbanks, St. Paul, Nebraska, picked up his 500th win as head coach of the St. Paul High School Men’s Volleyball team on Sept. 5, 2020. Matt has been coaching at St. Paul since 2007.

02 Tarasa Oldridge Gardner, Kirksville, Missouri, was named Distinguished Educator at Moberly Area Community College for professional excellence and outstanding ability as a language and literature faculty member and Developmental English Department Coordinator.

03 Cara Calloway Young, PhD, FNP-BC, FAANP, Austin, Texas, was selected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners and a Rising Star Faculty by the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties. She is an associate professor in the School of Nursing at the University of Texas Austin.

17 Steven Roschitz,San Antonio, Texas, is fresh off his third season as a pro beach volleyball player. He made 4 of the 7 AVP Main Draws in 2019 and was one of eight athletes up for Rookie of the Year on the tour. He has established himself as one of the top Open players in Texas and currently ranks No. 1 in the state, having garnered multiple Open victories and Top 3 finishes.
