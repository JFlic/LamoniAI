A distinguished group of individuals, our Presidential Society members are vital to the growth of our institution. Through their generous support, our Presidential Society members are doing more than just funding education – they’re transforming lives and helping to ensure every student has the opportunity to create their own Graceland Experience.

As a Presidential Society member, you can help provide opportunities for learning, personal growth, and discovery, ensuring that the experiences and relationships formed at Graceland are carried forward throughout our students’ lives.

To become a member, you must give(one or  more):

Anyone who provides for the University in their estate may become a member of the Graceland University Heritage Club. As members, the alumni and friends of Graceland University extend their influence for generations to come, by supporting the University in its mission to provide a quality education for promising and deserving students.

Annual events recognizing new Heritage Club members are held on the Lamoni campus during Homecoming. Members will have their names placed on a permanent Heritage Club Roll of Honor displayed on the first floor of the Higdon Administration Building.

The Legacy Society recognizes deceased supporters of Graceland that achieved a lifetime or lifetime/estate gift combination total of $100,000 or more. Their names will appear in the Honor Roll of Donors beginning in 2009-10 to ensure their exemplary support is not forgotten.
