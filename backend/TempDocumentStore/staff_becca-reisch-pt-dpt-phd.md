Independence Campus

Physical Therapy Department

Dr. Reisch leads the evidence-based practice (EBP) courses, and she also participates in the delivery of musculoskeletal and pelvic health content. She coordinates the EBP curriculum, in collaboration with the Director of Curriculum and Program Director, and she mentors other faculty members in scholarship and general professional development.

Dr. Reisch loves helping students understand real-life application of research, and how to integrate current research into clinical practice. She also enjoys helping students understand the importance of pelvic health physical therapy, both as a specialty area and in general practice.

I’m passionate about helping students understand the “big picture” of physical therapy. I value hearing all students’ voices and getting to know my students on a personal level so I can help them succeed. In my free time, I spend as much time outdoors as possible, preferably on a bike.
