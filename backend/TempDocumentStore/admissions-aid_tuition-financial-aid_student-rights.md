# Student Rights

Your Right to Privacy

The Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that limits access to all information students provide to Graceland University. The following overview is meant to provide you with a basic understanding about how this information will be treated by the university.

FERPA designates certain information as directory information that can be made available to third parties without a student’s consent. Directory information consists of:

Graceland University treats a student’s social security number, class schedule information, student records and all financial records as private information that falls under the confidential information guidelines below.

Under the act, access to confidential information is restricted to:

Confidentiality

Students have the option of marking their directory information records “confidential” to restrict all access. The decision to request complete confidentiality should not be made lightly, as it carries the following ramifications:

Information regarding your student’s Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and financial aid will not be released to anyone other than the student and parents who claim the student as a dependent on their Federal Income Tax Return unless the student grants permission. If he or she wants information released to another individual, such as a parent of whom the student is not a dependent or an outside scholarship agency, the student must complete a release form and submit it to Financial Aid Services.
