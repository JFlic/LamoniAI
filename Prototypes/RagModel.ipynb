Mi Scott is well known to a great many of our readers and will need no introduction from us. His connection with the Herald Office for about 30 years has given him large experience in the \\'art preservative\\' and will be of great benefit to the C h r o n i c l e.

This addition will put us in a position to do our own press work, and give us added facilities for Job work. An n o t a b l e change took place in newspaper circles last week, when the Chicago Record was purchased by the owners of the Times-Herald and the two papers united under the name of the Herald-Record. The two papers were among the very best papers in the city of Chicago, and that means that they were among the very best in the world, and their union brings to the new paper some exceptionally strong points, which are sure to make it a winner Mr. L arson, who made the Record what it was, in thus disposing of tho child of his era\\'GV does so to devote his time move closely to another creature of his development, the News, which enjoys the largest circulation in the city of Chicago In the Chad GE which thus gives to the reading public of this part of the United States the Record-Herald causes the disappearance of one of Chicago\\'s \\'land-marks,\\' the Times, which thus entirely loses its identity by being twice merged into other papers, and its name-dropped in the last transaction No doubt Mr. Kolkata feels proud of his new paper, and he will probably succeed in giving the readers of both papers no reason to feel regret for the change of hands of the Record and its merging into the Herald. Success to the Record Herald! Railroad Combine. T h e r e has been considerable talk of late in railroad circles about the Burlington system having passed into the control of J. J. Hill, who is directing the Northern and Union Pacific systems According to re\\xad ports this was accomplished by the Morgan-Harriman syndicate purchasing a controlling interest in the road an<i subsequently leasing the road to Hill. In some places this re\\xad port is denied. Whether or not the report is true as co the Burlington system, it is clearly evident that the railroads are fast accomplishing what is the equivalent of pooling their interests, and that despite the fact that the government has legislated against pooling. It is not pooling, however, for the combination is accomplished in a strictly legitimate and practical way, namely, by the syndicate purchasing controlling interests in the various l\\'roads they desire to combine and this prosecution of the \\'community of interest\\' plan has progressed until now, if we can believe the r>port concerning the Burning\\xad ton, there is a grand total of 94.273 miles of railroad controlled by the syndicate promulgating the combi\\xad nation. This is the result of a belief on the part of the railroad managers that co-operation is more profitable than competition, as the Brooklyn Eagle puts it; and that paper also points out the economical soundness of the doctrine by stating the fact that millions of dollars can be saved which are now wasted because of the harmony which exists among the management of roads. Attention is also called to how we are in\\xad debuted to various labor\\' saving LAMONT, IOWA, APRIL 4, 1301. RIO. 4 2 machines, such as the \\'loom, the steam flouring mill, the sewing machine and such things\\' which \\'have given to us cheaper bread and better clothing than our ancestors had.\\' Then, classing the \\'community of interest\\' plan as one of the \\'labor savers,\\' the Eagle says: The run w ho invented the community of in the re st idea devised a lab o r saving com m social machine, and he only obeyed the irresistible forces the a t are compelling- m en to prevent all possible waste in the conduct of business as well as in the manufacture of various com modifies. Whether the m AK\\xad ERS of s ta TU the la w s like it o r n o t, and whether the closest economists think t h a t i t is wise, the\\' com m unity of in\\xad east\\'\\' plan w ill continue to govern the managers of the transportation concerns u n til a b e the r one is offered in its place. What the ultimate goal may be toward which we are tending no man knows, and it is not necessary to worry one\\'s self very much ab o u t it. We do know, however, that the world is seeking o u t the way to produce the greatest possible results with the ex\\xad expenditure of t h e LE an s t amount of energy, and the a t it will continue the a t search JU s t an s a sure an m of w a the r, in its flow to the sea, follow s the p a the of the least resistance. No doubt our \\'calamity\\' friends see in the combination dark visions of another tentacled monster, and will vituperate the \\'octopus\\' in choicest \\'opposition\\' language; but the Brooklyn \"Eagle has tersely stated the truth of the matter in a t\\xad attributing the whole thing to the operations of economical laws and placing it outside the legislative realm. Statute enactment cannot possibly control absolutely what dep ends for its raison d\\'être upon economic laws and principles Rail\\xad roads were not brought into existence by statute enactment, neither have the\\' legislators\\' been lie potent factors in their steady and rapid growth. The combination is but a natural sequence to past developments, and with the editor of the Eagle we are disposed to be\\xad live that the community of interest plan will stay until its mission work will be completed, when something better comes to take its place. F r o m tho D e s M o i n e s C a p i t an l Otis Sees Immediate Peace. Chicago, March 2D -\\'Aguinaldo\\'s capture is the end of the insurrection, and it proves Gen. Function to be a great scout,\\' declared Major General El well S. Otis\\' With the taking of the insurgent leader what little opposition existed to the American rule will cease, I will venture the a t more peaceful conditions exist in the islands today than have existed for twenty-five years. \\'Gen. Function\\'s feat in capturing Aguinaldo was brave and deserves commendation. He and his officers and men risked their lives in the hands of the natives, and their bra\\xad very as easily might have led them to death as success. \\' Every army officer will rejoice over the capture of the wary insurgent, and there doubtless is a sort of ratification meeting being con\\xad ducted in Manila. The best class of the natives will be happy at Gen. Function\\'s success. \\'There now remains but two Filipino officers of any importance in the islands, who still retain their hostility toward the United States. These are Generals Allies and Luc\\xad ban. They, no doubt, will become discouraged, their few followers will desert, and they to will be captured or will surrender. \\'It long had been Gen. Function\\'s hope that he would be able to capture Aguinaldo While in command in the Philippines I sent him on a scouting expedition through the territory in which ho realized his hope. It is a p art of the wildest country found on the island-. Function probably was the best posted man on the nature of the country in the army. It is my understanding that he effected the capture about ninety miles inland. To reach that point Function and his men had to march through mountains covered with undergrowth. There were no roads and only narrow bridle paths here and there. When the nature of the country is taken into consideration the capture is the more remarkable. \\'As to the effect of the capture of Aguinaldo will have on our affairs in the islands, I believe that it will have\\xad ten the time when absolute peace wife restored Of course, the people will have to be protected for some time V> come, but I think in a few months or a year the people will be able-\\'to protect themselves. The capture will result in the decrease of the military demands of the Philip\\xad pines. We now AI\\'e withdrawing our troops as rapidly as possible. Rob\\xad BER bands are operating in the interior, and they will continue to rob the people as long as they can, but they will be suppressed. \\'Gen. Lucian is said to have made near\\'LY a half million out of the insurrection by robbing the natives. On one pretext and another he would secure their property and appropriate the proceeds. He is understood to have sent over $300,000 from the islands to China for safe keeping. Naturally the natives have become tired of that kind of thing. \\'Aguinaldo is not an educated man, as is generally understood, but he is cunning and possesses certain abilities as a leader. Owing to the superstitions of the ignorant classes he was long looked upon a sort of god. His capture will dispel this delusion.\\' Personally, he is honest, in my opinion, but he is intensely am\\xad bilious. He has been actuated by that ambition rather than by desire of gain, as have some of the other leaders. \\'Just what punishment should be meted out to the insurgent leader is a problem. His trial by an military commit\\'Sion would be the natural coup\\'see of procedure, and a sentence of death would be possible. We are not a bloodthirsty people, however, and some other form of punishment may be fixed Should Aguinaldo take tho oath of allegiance to the United States, I am inclined to think he is enough of a man to ob\\xad serve it in the future.\\'\\'  F r o m t l i o C h i c a g o T r j b u n c.  .Iowa and lie Tariff. The Now York Times says\\' there is something in the air of Iowa that breeds independence and courage \\'\\' I t refers to the action of Senator Grimes in defeating the impeachment of Andrew Johnson and to\\' the silent but powerful influence\\' recently exert d by Senator Allison to defeat the ship subsidy bill. There is every reason to believe that when the next Congress meets and there comes before it-as assuredly will be the case-the question of reducing tariff duties, which lend themselves to the illegitimate purposes of trusts and combines, the Iowa Congressmen will be found as strongly in favor of judicious tariff reduction as is Mr. Roberts. Iowa Republicans never have favored that doctrine of excessive protection which has obtained in Pennsylvania and some other eastern states. Their Representatives will not be found voting for the continuance of a diseased form of protection which enables American manufacturers to control the home market and charge domes\\xad tic consumers high prices for goods while selling these same goods to foreign consumers at much lower prices. But it is not in the interest of American consumers alone that ex\\xad massive tariff duties should be reduced. As Mint Director Roberts has pointed out, it is in the interest of the manufacturers who have become exporters They will find their foreign markets seriously interfered with by retaliatory legislation if the Employ tariff law is to be treated as if one of the laws of the Modes and Persians. Some of the manufacturers arc coming to see this To be protected abroad they must waive un\\xad necessary plot. I t ion at home In this great W\\'>OK of revising the tariff to secure better markets abroad for American manufacturers and agricultural products the Re\\xad publican Congressmen, not from Iowa alone but from other western states should be foremost.

By the prompt application of water the fire was put out before the engine could be got to work. With, com\\xad mendable promptness the firemen dragged the engine through the deep mud and were ready for work. Several of the fire boys soon found themselves minus their overshoes lost in mud.

Success to the Record Herald! Railroad Combine. T h e r e has been considerable talk of late in railroad circles about the Burlington system having passed into the control of J. J. Hill, who is directing the Northern and Union Pacific systems According to re\\xad ports this was accomplished by the Morgan-Harriman syndicate purchasing a controlling interest in the road an<i subsequently leasing the road to Hill. In some places this re\\xad port is denied. Whether or not the report is true as co the Burlington system, it is clearly evident that the railroads are fast accomplishing what is the equivalent of pooling their interests, and that despite the fact that the government has legislated against pooling. It is not pooling, however, for the combination is accomplished in a strictly legitimate and practical way, namely, by the syndicate purchasing controlling interests in the various l\\'roads they desire to combine and this prosecution of the \\'community of interest\\' plan has progressed until now, if we can believe the r>port concerning the Burning\\xad ton, there is a grand total of 94.273 miles of railroad controlled by the syndicate promulgating the combi\\xad nation. This is the result of a belief on the part of the railroad managers that co-operation is more profitable than competition, as the Brooklyn Eagle puts it; and that paper also points out the economical soundness of the doctrine by stating the fact that millions of dollars can be saved which are now wasted because of the harmony which exists among the management of roads. Attention is also called to how we are in\\xad debuted to various labor\\' saving LAMONT, IOWA, APRIL 4, 1301.

No doubt our \\'calamity\\' friends see in the combination dark visions of another tentacled monster, and will vituperate the \\'octopus\\' in choicest \\'opposition\\' language; but the Brooklyn \"Eagle has tersely stated the truth of the matter in a t\\xad attributing the whole thing to the operations of economical laws and placing it outside the legislative realm.

F r o m tho D e s M o i n e s C a p i t an l Otis Sees Immediate Peace. Chicago, March 2D -\\'Aguinaldo\\'s capture is the end of the insurrection, and it proves Gen. Function to be a great scout,\\' declared Major General El well S. Otis\\' With the taking of the insurgent leader what little opposition existed to the American rule will cease, I will venture the a t more peaceful conditions exist in the islands today than have existed for twenty-five years. \\'Gen. Function\\'s feat in capturing Aguinaldo was brave and deserves commendation. He and his officers and men risked their lives in the hands of the natives, and their bra\\xad very as easily might have led them to death as success. \\' Every army officer will rejoice over the capture of the wary insurgent, and there doubtless is a sort of ratification meeting being con\\xad ducted in Manila. The best class of the natives will be happy at Gen. Function\\'s success. \\'There now remains but two Filipino officers of any importance in the islands, who still retain their hostility toward the United States. These are Generals Allies and Luc\\xad ban. They, no doubt, will become discouraged, their few followers will desert, and they to will be captured or will surrender. \\'It long had been Gen. Function\\'s hope that he would be able to capture Aguinaldo While in command in the Philippines I sent him on a scouting expedition through the territory in which ho realized his hope. It is a p art of the wildest country found on the island-. Function probably was the best posted man on the nature of the country in the army. It is my understanding that he effected the capture about ninety miles inland. To reach that point Function and his men had to march through mountains covered with undergrowth. There were no roads and only narrow bridle paths here and there. When the nature of the country is taken into consideration the capture is the more remarkable. \\'As to the effect of the capture of Aguinaldo will have on our affairs in the islands, I believe that it will have\\xad ten the time when absolute peace wife restored Of course, the people will have to be protected for some time V> come, but I think in a few months or a year the people will be able-\\'to protect themselves. The capture will result in the decrease of the military demands of the Philip\\xad pines. We now AI\\'e withdrawing our troops as rapidly as possible. Rob\\xad BER bands are operating in the interior, and they will continue to rob the people as long as they can, but they will be suppressed. \\'Gen. Lucian is said to have made near\\'LY a half million out of the insurrection by robbing the natives. On one pretext and another he would secure their property and appropriate the proceeds. He is understood to have sent over $300,000 from the islands to China for safe keeping. Naturally the natives have become tired of that kind of thing. \\'Aguinaldo is not an educated man, as is generally understood, but he is cunning and possesses certain abilities as a leader. Owing to the superstitions of the ignorant classes he was long looked upon a sort of god. His capture will dispel this delusion.\\' Personally, he is honest, in my opinion, but he is intensely am\\xad bilious. He has been actuated by that ambition rather than by desire of gain, as have some of the other leaders. \\'Just what punishment should be meted out to the insurgent leader is a problem. His trial by an military commit\\'Sion would be the natural coup\\'see of procedure, and a sentence of death would be possible. We are not a bloodthirsty people, however, and some other form of punishment may be fixed Should Aguinaldo take tho oath of allegiance to the United States, I am inclined to think he is enough of a man to ob\\xad serve it in the future.\\'\\'  F r o m t l i o C h i c a g o T r j b u n c.  .Iowa and lie Tariff. The Now York Times says\\' there is something in the air of Iowa that breeds independence and courage \\'\\' I t refers to the action of Senator Grimes in defeating the impeachment of Andrew Johnson and to\\' the silent but powerful influence\\' recently exert d by Senator Allison to defeat the ship subsidy bill. There is every reason to believe that when the next Congress meets and there comes before it-as assuredly will be the case-the question of reducing tariff duties, which lend themselves to the illegitimate purposes of trusts and combines, the Iowa Congressmen will be found as strongly in favor of judicious tariff reduction as is Mr. Roberts. Iowa Republicans never have favored that doctrine of excessive protection which has obtained in Pennsylvania and some other eastern states. Their Representatives will not be found voting for the continuance of a diseased form of protection which enables American manufacturers to control the home market and charge domes\\xad tic consumers high prices for goods while selling these same goods to foreign consumers at much lower prices. But it is not in the interest of American consumers alone that ex\\xad massive tariff duties should be reduced. As Mint Director Roberts has pointed out, it is in the interest of the manufacturers who have become exporters They will find their foreign markets seriously interfered with by retaliatory legislation if the Employ tariff law is to be treated as if one of the laws of the Modes and Persians. Some of the manufacturers arc coming to see this To be protected abroad they must waive un\\xad necessary plot. I t ion at home In this great W\\'>OK of revising the tariff to secure better markets abroad for American manufacturers and agricultural products the Re\\xad publican Congressmen, not from Iowa alone but from other western states should be foremost.

In some places this re\\xad port is denied. Whether or not the report is true as co the Burlington system, it is clearly evident that the railroads are fast accomplishing what is the equivalent of pooling their interests, and that despite the fact that the government has legislated against pooling.

This is the result of a belief on the part of the railroad managers that co-operation is more profitable than competition, as the Brooklyn Eagle puts it; and that paper also points out the economical soundness of the doctrine by stating the fact that millions of dollars can be saved which are now wasted because of the harmony which exists among the management of roads.

Our motto fair representation.'Yours Truly, Lamont Hardware Co. ^uuuauLitiktuuuumiuuiiiuuiiimiuuuuuuimiiiiimiiUiUiiiUUiiAiimAiii^ The C h r o n i c l e appears this issue under a new heading and with the addition of Mr John Scott to the firm. Mi Scott is well known to a great many of our readers and will need no introduction from us. His connection with the Herald Office for about 30 years has given him large experience in the 'art preservative' and will be of great benefit to the C h r o n i c l e. We have also added to our equipment a 6 column quarto Campbell cylinder press, that will be in position some time next week. This addition will put us in a position to do our own press work, and give us added facilities for Job work. An n o t a b l e change took place in newspaper circles last week, when the Chicago Record was purchased by the owners of the Times-Herald and the two papers united under the name of the Herald-Record. The two papers were among the very best papers in the city of Chicago, and that means that they were among the very best in the world, and their union brings to the new paper some exceptionally strong points, which are sure to make it a winner Mr. L arson, who made the Record what it was, in thus disposing of tho child of his era'GV does so to devote his time move closely to another creature of his development, the News, which enjoys the largest circulation in the city of Chicago In the Chad GE which thus gives to the reading public of this part of the United States the Record-Herald causes the disappearance of one of Chicago's 'land-marks,' the Times, which thus entirely loses its identity by being twice merged into other papers, and its name-dropped in the last transaction No doubt Mr. Kolkata feels proud of his new paper, and he will probably succeed in giving the readers of both papers no reason to feel regret for the change of hands of the Record and its merging into the Herald. Success to the Record Herald. Railroad Combine.\",\n",

But it isn't 't second-class matter. I h ave read it, and it is first-class m a t­ TER. The binding and get-up may be second class, h u t the matter is first-class.'The boy wrote to John Bur­ roughs as he would write to any other boyfriend whom he considered had been dealt with unjustly. He had read the book, and he knew, and w anted to' assure his friend, the a t what he from was first-class matter in s p ite 'OT what any -postmaster 'general said.\n",
