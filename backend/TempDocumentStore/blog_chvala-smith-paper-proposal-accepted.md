May 11, 2017

A paper proposal titled, “In Life and in Death: Barth, Bonhoeffer and the Path from the Great War to the Confessing Church,” by Anthony Chvala-Smith, Paul E. Morden Seminary Chair in Religion, has been accepted for presentation at a conference at the National World War 1 Museum in Kansas City, Oct. 19-22. The conference is titled Remembering Muted Voices: Conscience, Dissent, Resistance and Civil Liberties in World War 1 through Today. Information about the conference can be found at https://www.theworldwar.org/learn/remembering-muted-voices . Chvala-Smith will argue in his paper that Karl Barth’s and Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s experience, memory and interpretation of the trauma of WWI substantially shaped their theological/ecclesial resistance to Nazism in the 1930s.
