In addition to a special dinners for these honor classes, we will have activities, events and meals planned for all alumni regardless of class year.

Every Homecoming, Graceland honors distinguished alumni and friends at its annual alumni awards banquet. It recognizes three awards: the Graceland Award of Recognition, the Honorary Alumni Award, and the Distinguished Service Award and new this year, we are happy to recognize our Wall of Fame and Hall of Fame inductees.

While the 2025 awardees have yet to be chosen, here are the 2024 honorees.

Each year, Graceland inducts distinguished alumni into its athletic program’s hall of fame and wall of fame. Since they were established, Graceland has honored those alumni each Homecoming with a presentation at halftime of the Homecoming football game. This year, we are also honoring these alumni at the Friday night Alumni and Friends Awards Banquet to be held in the Shaw Center Lobby.

The Hall of Fame recognizes exceptional individuals for their athletic accomplishments during their tenure at Graceland, while the Wall of Fame commemorates teams for their athletic achievements while at Graceland.
