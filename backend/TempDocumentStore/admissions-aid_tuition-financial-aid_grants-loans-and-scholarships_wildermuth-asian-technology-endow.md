The Wildermuth Asian — Technology Endowed Scholarship is awarded to Asian-Pacific students, who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents, to pursue Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT) at Graceland University. Awards range from $1,000 to $3,000 and are renewable for all four years of study. Applicants do not need prior experience or training in computer technologies, but rather an interest in computing, an aptitude for math or science, and good communication skills.

If awarded an Wildermuth Scholarship you must accept certain conditions to maintain for all four years, including good grades as a CSIT major and participation in CSIT related clubs, activities and projects.

he CSIT program is also supported by the Ackerley endowment that funds many things that will benefit all CSIT students. These include frequent upgrades of high-end workstations, coverage for professional dues, trip expenses (travel, hotel, meals) for CSIT conferences and funding for hardware or software needed on projects that you might be interested in pursuing.

We encourage you to send an email to let us know that you plan to submit an application rather than wait until you have completed everything.

For more information, contact Kevin Brunner by phone at 641.784.5175 or by email atbrunner@graceland.edu.
