January 5, 2018

On behalf of the University, the Board of Trustees has retained the services of AGB Search and Dr. Richard F. Giese (Washington, DC) to assist us in this important work.  Prior to joining AGB Search, Dr. Giese served as President of both Monmouth College (IL) and the University of Mount Union (OH).  His two most recent searches have been for the President of Fisher College (Boston) and the VP and Chief Financial Officer at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary.

Dr. Giese was on both campuses in December to meet and receive input for the next VPAA.  As a result of his visit and the review of materials regarding the university, its challenges and opportunities, Dr. Giese drafted the prospectus/profile outlining the leadership opportunities and attributes required for the new VPAA.  The search committee then edited, revised and ultimately approved it.

Christi Dickerson will be assisting the search committee with its work.  Any questions regarding the search may be directed through Christi.  Nominations for the position would be welcomed by Dr. Giese atrichard.giese@agbsearch.com.  Frequently, successful searches are the result of a nomination from an individual close to the institution.

The general timeline for the search is as follows.  The VPAA position will be advertised next week.  The search committee will be working with AGB over the next few months reviewing applications.  Interviews on campus and selection are targeted for April with the hope of the new VPAA starting in July.
