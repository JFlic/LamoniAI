# Graceland University C.H. Sandage School of Business

Source URL: http://www.graceland.edu/business#top

Take your first step towards a successful business career.

Graceland University’s school of business offers numerous opportunities for in-classroom study and experiential learning for students interested in a business degree. We believe hands-on experience not only helps students better understand their coursework, but gives them an advantage over others when looking for a job.

Graceland’s C.H. Sandage School of Business is regularly recognized for its entrepreneurship and programs and is a proud member of the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).

Designed to fit the needs of all students, we offer undergraduate business programs (both majors and minors) on campus and online.

We partner with the prestigious Seton Hall University to offer students the opportunity to pursue a graduate degree in Diplomacy and International Relations from one of the top-ranked programs of its kind in the world.

See what makes Graceland great by checking out our main residential campus located in the small town of Lamoni, Iowa.

Our commuter campus in Independence, Missouri serves as an in-person location for all our online business programs.

Our business school is named after Graceland alumni and member of the Advertising Hall of Fame, Charles H. Sandage. Known as the Father of Advertising Education, Sandage was a true educational entrepreneur, creative thinker and successful writer who published five books, including “Advertising Theory and Practice”, which has been used extensively in advertising education for decades.

We are often asked, what exactly is Enactus?Part of the national Enactus organization, teams of students examine needs in their community, identify potential solutions and lead community impact projects. This allows communities to benefit from innovative ideas, plus students gain real world experience to advance their personal and professional lives. Projects are presented at the national Enactus competition where Graceland competes against over 500 other universities every spring.

Graceland Enactus is sponsored by The Sandage Center for the Study of Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship. The Sandage Center seeks to perpetuate the spirit of free enterprise in students, faculty and community. The study of America’s entrepreneurial tradition enhances and strengthens our economy by encouraging innovation and by familiarizing young people with a knowledge of the principles and history of free enterprise.
