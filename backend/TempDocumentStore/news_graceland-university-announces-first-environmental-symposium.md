September 3, 2015

TheGraceland University Sustainabilityprogram is delighted to announce the firstGraceland Environmental Symposium. The event will be held Friday, Oct. 16, during the 2015homecomingweekend on the Lamoni campus.

After attending a Climate Reality Project Leader Training in Chicago earlier this year, inspired GU alumnus Leon Probasco ‘72 had an idea. He reached out to Graceland’s sustainability coordinator,Jen Abraham-White, to co-create an environmentally educational event on campus, which turned into a homecoming weekend symposium. The main goal of the symposium is to bring together environmentally conscious alumni in order to form a committee that would advise sustainability projects on campus, among other charges.

This symposium will showcase environmental professionals and researchers from a variety of backgrounds, all of whom will speak on this year’s symposium theme, “Changing Paradigms.” The conference will focus on environmental issues, from wind and solar energy to food waste.

“The quality of speakers we’ve attracted for this first environmental symposium is impressive,” said Abraham-White. “My hope is that our pro-environmental alumni base, young and old, will take advantage of the timing of the symposium – during homecoming weekend – to join us and help to build a strong network of EnviroAlums.”

The list of speakers will definitely be a draw for the event. They will include the former National Wildlife Federation President, Larry Schweiger, speaking on climate change, environmental stewardship and preserving biodiversity. See the complete list of speakers atwww.graceland.edu/sustainability/Symposium.

Probasco, a self-described “green” alumnus, asks other Graceland alumni who are concerned about the future of our planet to attend the event. “Come and join other blue, gold and ‘green’ alumni interested in supporting Graceland environmental studies and sustainability projects!”

Alumni who are interested in forming an EnviroAlumni network to support environmental studies and sustainability practices at Graceland University – and in the Lamoni community–are encouraged to attend the Friday conference and/or the Saturday follow-up meeting to discuss the purpose, goals and formation of this green alumni network.

Goals of the EnviroAlumni group will include the following:
