INDIANAPOLIS–Feb. 7, 2017–Allstate Insurance Company, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) announced today the 20 student-athletes who have been named to the 2017 Allstate NABC and WBCA Good Works Teams®. Lamoni native and Graceland men’s basketball junior center,Jeremy Deemer, has been named to the team.

While exceptional student-athletes are often rewarded for their competitive achievements, this award shines a light on 20 young men and women for the things they accomplish off the court. From contributing to those affected by the Flint water crisis to visiting Nigeria to educate girls about how to succeed on and off the basketball court, this year’s teams made a positive, lasting impact.

Graceland University Head Men’s Basketball Coach Craig Doty said of Deemer, “Jeremy is an individual who embodies all that is good about being a student-athlete. His commitment to community service, academics, clubs and organizations around campus, and to our basketball program is second to none. We are incredibly proud of Jeremy for his recognition on the NABC Good Works Team presented by Allstate. What an outstanding honor for a great person.”

Deemer has displayed his commitment to service in various ways throughout the Lamoni and Graceland community. This past summer, Deemer contributed over 450 hours of community service through AmeriCorps and worked as a summer league softball coach for fifth and sixth graders.

The business major serves as a captain on the basketball team, part of Communication Club, and on the executive board of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC), where he serves as the head of social media. He is also a member of ENACTUS – the entrepreneurial club, which won the world competition 10 years ago. A member of the community unity team for Enactus, Deemer helps coordinate community activities.

“Jeremy is a fine example of the Graceland Student Athlete,” said Joe Worlund, Graceland University Athletic Director. “I am thrilled for him to be recognized on such a large scale. Jeremy contributes greatly on the court, he also is heavily involved on campus as a member of Enactus and the SAAC Executive Board. He is perfect to represent Graceland as a member of the Good Works Team. It is nice to see Jeremy rewarded for his athletic, scholarship as well as his community service efforts that he has been a part of, represented on behalf of Graceland University.”

The Allstate NABC and WBCA Good Works Teams®are each comprised of 10 student-athletes – five from NCAA®Division I, and five from NCAA Divisions II, III and the NAIA. This year, sports information directors and coaches at colleges and universities across the country submitted a record 278 nominations, and in December 2016, 181 nominees from the NABC and 97 nominees from the WBCA were announced.

In addition to dedicating countless hours to their studies and athletics, the members of this year’s team have spent their limited free time bettering communities all over the world and demonstrating a strong commitment to improving the lives of others.

Members of the Allstate NABC Good Works Team®will be invited by Allstate to be recognized at the 2017 NABC Convention and 2017 NCAA Men’s Final Four®and will participate in a community service project to benefit Phoenix, the host city. Additionally, the members of the Allstate WBCA Good Works Team®will be recognized during the 2017 WBCA Convention and at the 2017 NCAA Women’s Final Four®in Dallas, and will also participate in a local community project there. Allstate is an official corporate partner of the NABC, WBCA and NCAA.

“For five years, the Allstate Good Works Team program has showcased men’s and women’s basketball collegiate athletes for their extraordinary benevolent actions performed away from the court,” said Jim Haney, NABC executive director. “We applaud the group of 20 selected for this year’s teams whose humanitarian efforts have helped raise the human spirit locally, nationally and globally.”
