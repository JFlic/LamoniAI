Welcome to Graceland University School of Nursing. Our nursing program offers prospective students a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate level degrees. Delivery options include face-to-face and online learning modalities.  The School of Nursing’s outstanding faculty and staff are eager to assist you in reaching your goals. Whether you are beginning a career in nursing or advancing your nursing career, the Graceland University School of Nursing is dedicated to preparing professional nurses to meet the health care needs of our communities.

The School of Nursing strives to:

As an integral part of Graceland University, the School of Nursing was framed by Christian beliefs as set forth in the Value Statements of the University that  further enhance the achievement of University General Education Goals by nursing students.

The goal of the nursing program is to enable students to become professional nurses who respect and care about the worth of all individuals, who are capable of thinking critically, and who can provide quality nursing care in diverse settings to individuals, families, communities and societies within the global health environment. Consequently, the School of Nursing educates students to become professional nurses who synthesize and apply concepts from the liberal arts, nursing curricula, and nursing practice.

As reflective practitioners, professional nurses apply the nursing process in a holistic and caring way to promote the optimal health of individuals, families, and communities. The roles of the professional nurse include Learner, Clinician, and Leader. Development within each role occurs along a novice-to-expert level continuum.

Learning is life-long. Learners possess intellectual curiosity fostered by the incorporation of current research findings (evidence) in their nursing practice. Clinicians provide competent, holistic care across the lifespan. Nurse Leaders collaborate with other health disciplines to develop policies and institute changes in healthcare.

Professional Nursing Standards, the AACN Essentials for BSN and MSN Education, and the missions, goals, and philosophies of the University and School of Nursing guide curricular development and delineation of expected student learning outcomes. Curricula are developed to instill professional nursing values and a commitment to Evidence-Based practice. Effective learning is best facilitated by employment of active learning and self-reflective strategies.

Central to the mission, goals, and curricular design of Graceland University’s School of Nursing programs is the development and achievement of student learning outcomes necessary for practice as baccalaureate generalist nurses, nurse practitioners, and nurse educators. All graduates are expected to achieve student learning outcomes related to higher level thinking, communication, and nursing role performance.

Entry into professional nursing begins with education at the baccalaureate level. At all levels the educational process is a shared endeavor between students and faculty. Opportunities for theoretical and experiential learning are provided in an atmosphere that stimulates each learner. The faculty support learning communities for traditional as well as nontraditional students. Each student has the right and responsibility to develop his/her highest personal and professional potential.

The Graceland Pi Eta Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing was chartered in March, 2000. STTI has a total of 520 chapters and over 135,000 active, dues-paying members who live in more than 90 different countries. Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing is a prestigious organization that provides many exciting opportunities for nurses around the world. Students are invited into the honor society based on academic achievement and academic integrity. Explorewww.nursingsociety.orgfor more information about Sigma Theta Tau.

Graceland University’s history as an institution for educating nurses dates back more than 50 years. Originally a diploma program that was a partnership with the Independence Sanitarium and Hospital, Graceland’s nursing program has been a leader for decades. 1968 – 69 marked the first cohort of students in the baccalaureate program and, over 50 years later, the School of Nursing continues to produce graduates who are empathetic, committed to patient care and among the most respected in the profession.
