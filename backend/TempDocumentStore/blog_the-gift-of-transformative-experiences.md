Initially started as a scholarship fund in memory of his brother Jeff ’74, the endowment later expanded to supportHonorsin commemoration of the dedication to the university and program made by his sister Barbara Hiles Mesle ’72 and brother-in-law Robert “Bob” Mesle ’72. With his donation, Hiles highlights the importance of providing an enriched educational experience for talented students, particularly those from rural communities where educational opportunities may be scarce.

With a career in higher education advancement spanning over three decades across several universities, he understands the transformative potential of comprehensive Honors experiences. His philanthropic gesture is a call to action for alumni to invest in the places that shape lives.

“I want to be a role model for giving back,” said Hiles. “It’s important to give to institutions like Graceland — who have made such a profound impact on our lives.”

TOM HILES ’82

Hiles’ planned gift secures the Honors Program’s continued success, fostering a culture of interdisciplinary inquiry and real-world learning, essential for nurturing the next generation of thinkers and leaders. This strengthens the program, enriching its tradition of academic excellence and cultural growth for students.
