Graceland University senior art exhibits are currently on display on the Lamoni, Iowa, campus. The first of two groups will be on display through Friday, April 5, with a reception from 4-6 p.m. Saturday, March 30. A second set will open Monday, April 8, and run through April 19. Its reception will run from 4-8 p.m. Saturday, April 13. Some of the works will be for sale at the option of the student.

The Helene galleries are open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Friday or by appointment. Both sets of shows will fully take over the Constance Gallery and the two student galleries down the hall. One exhibition will even be in the Graceland observatory in Resch Science and Technology Hall, and one in the show music hallway!

The supervising faculty instructor position for senior exhibits rotates each year. In addition to Assistant Professor of Art Karen Gergely, this year’s designee, the department includes Professor of Art Julia Franklin-Jones and Assistant Professor of Art Bilawal (BK) Khoso, who both also serve as mentors to senior art majors.

According to Gergely, the two shows could have as many as 20 separate pieces that will represent different media, sizes and concepts. The senior exhibit is the rigorous capstone assignment for an art major. Gergely explains that the show should demonstrate the students’ planning and completion of a consistent body of work on a particular idea, material or process.

Students are required to give an artist talk, either at the exhibit opening or at the university Scholars’ Showcase April 11. All seniors must have a web presence for their exhibit plus advertisements and business cards.

Gergely reports that art students are excited with the recent acquisition of a new printer that allows them to print large, high quality works and provides important experience for future employment.

In Gergely’s words, “We are extremely proud of our seniors for really rising to this challenge. This is a high-impact practice where students are learning to research, process and create on a really intense scale. They learn how to market themselves, put a professional portfolio together, curate and hang an exhibition to accomplish something grand.”

She adds, “We encourage students to really embrace their potential, take big risks, believe in themselves, support each other and know when to ask for help! Discipline and honest critique are key factors for our students to have a successful exhibition and skills they will carry with them throughout their entire lives.”

The public is invited to view the students’ work and attend the receptions.
