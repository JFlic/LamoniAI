(Copyright,  1901,  by  Louis  Klopsch,  Is'.  Y.) Washington, April 7.-The great Christian  festival  celebrated  in  nil  the churches is  the theme of  Dr. T alniage's discourse;  I  Corinthians  xv,  20,  ' Now is  C h ris t  risen  from  the  dead  an d   be­ come  the  first fruits ot  them,  th a t slept "

On  this  glorious  Easter morning, ■imid the  music  and  the  flowers,  I give  you  Christian  salutation. This morning,  Russian  meeting  R ussian  on th e   s tr e e ts   of  St.  P etersburg  h a ils  him with  the  salutation,  'Christ  is  ris e n '' and  is  answered  by  his  friend  in  salu­ ta tio n ,  ' He  is  risen  indeed!' In  some p a r ts of  England  and  Ireland  to  this very  day  there  is  the  superstition  th at on  E aster  me  ling  the  sun  dances  in t h e   heavens. And well  may  we  forgive such  a   superstition,  which  illustrates t h e   f a c t  th a t  th e  n atu ra l  w o rld   seem s to  sympathize  with  the  spiritual.

ies;  we  gave  them  to  you  In  corrup­ tion; surrender  them  now  in  incor­ ruption.' Hundreds  of  spirits  hover­ ing  about  the  fields  ot  Gettysburg,  for there  tho  bodies  nro  buried. A  hun­ dred  thousand  spirits coming to Green­ wood,  for  there  the  bodies  are  buried, waiting  for  the  reunion  of  body  nnd soul.

All  along  the  sea  route  from  New York  to  Liverpool,  a t  every  few  miles where  a  steam er  w ent  down,  departed spirits  coming  back,  hovering  over the wave.  There  is  w here  the  City of  Bos­ ton  perished. Found  a t  lust. There  is where  the  President  perished. Steam­ er  found  at  last. There  is  where  the Central  America  w ent  down. Spirits hovering,  hundreds  of  spirits.lioverlng waiting  for  the  reunion  of  body and |  soul. Out on  the  prairie a  spirit alights. Thero  is  where  a  traveler died  in  the  snow. Crash  goes  W est­ minster  abbey,  and  tho  poets  and  the orators  come  forth;  wonderful  ming­ ling  of  good  and  bad. Crash  go  the pyramids  of  Egypt,  and  the  monarclis come  forth.

## T h e   Im m o rta l  11 o it jr.

Hail, Easter morning! Flowers' Flow ers' All  of  them  a-voice,  all  of th e m a-tongue,  all  of  them  full of ' speech  to-day. I  bend  over  one  of  the  . lilies,  and  I  hear  it  say.  'C onsider  the  ! lilies  of  the  field,  how  they  grow ;  they  : toil  not,  neither  do  they  spin,  y et  Sol-  I omon  in  all  his  glory  was  n o t  arrayed like  one  of  these.' 1  bend  over  a  rose and  it  seems  to  whisper,  'I  am   the rose  of  Sharon ' And  then  I  stand and  listen. From all  sides  th ere  comes th e   chorus  of  flowers,  saying.  'If  God so  clothed  the  grass  of  the  field  which to-day  is  and  to-morrow  is  cast  into the oven,  shall  he  not  much  more clothe  you,  0   ye  of  little  fa ith ? '*

Flowers! Flowers! Braid  them   in ­ to  the  bride's  hair. Flowers! Flc.vers! Strew them  over the graves of the dead,  sweet  prophecy  of  the  resurrec­ tion.*  Flowers' Flowers!  Tw ist  them into  a   garland  for  my  Lord  Jesus  on Easter  morning,  and  'Glory  bo  to  the F a th e r, and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the Holy  Ghost  ;as  it  was  in  the  begin­ ning,  is  now  and  ever  shall  be.' The women  came  to  the  Saviour's  tomb, and  they  dropped  spice?  all  around t h e tomb,  and  those  spices  were  the seed  th a t  began to  grow, and  from them  came all  the  flowers  o£  th is  E a st­ er morn. The  two  angels  robed  in white  took  hold  ot  the  stone  at  the Saviour's  tomb,  and  they  hurled  It with  such  force  down  the  hill  th a t  !t crushed  in  the  door  of  the  world's sepulchre  and  the  stark  and  the  dead must  come  forth.

## T lio   W o rld ' * Gront  Conquerors.

I f   I  should  come  to  you  and  ask  you for  the  names  of  the  great  conquerors of  the  world you  would  say  A lexander, Caesar,  Philip,  Napoleon  I. Ah,  you have  forgotten  to  mention  the  name of  a   greater  conqueror  than  all  these -a  cruel,  a  ghastly  conqueror. Ho rode  on  a  black  horse  across  W aterloo and  Chalons  and  Allanta,  the  bloody j  saved hoofs  crushing  the  hearts  of  nations. It  is  the  conqueror  Death. He  carries a  black  flag  aud  he  takes  no  prisoners. He  digs  a trench across  the  hem is­ pheres  and  fills  it  with  the  carcasses of  nations. Fifty times would  the world  have  been  depopulated  had  not j jo d kept making Fifty  times  the world would  havo ■swung  lifeless  through  tho a ir-no  man  ! ·on  th e  mountain,  no  man  on  the  sea,  1 an  abandoned  ship  plowing  through immensity. Again  and  again  has  ho done  this  work  with  all  generations. '1 He  is  a  monarch  as  well  as  a  conquer-  1 or,  his  palace  a  sepulcher; his  foun-  , ta in s   th e falling tears cf  a  world.  ; Blessed  be  God' In  the  lig h t  of  this E a s te r morning  I  see  the  prophecy ·that  his  scepter  shall  be  broken,  and his  palace  shall  be  demolished. Tho hour  is  coming  when  all  who  are  In t h e i r   graves  shall  com^  forth. Christ risen,  we  shall  rise Jesus,  ' the  first fru its  of  tbc-m  tha:  sle p t'

'But,'  you  say,  ' if  this  doctrine  of the  resurrection  is  true,  as  prefigured by  this  E aster  m orning,  can  you  tell us  something about the resurrected body'" I can. There are  mysteries about  that,  but  I  shall  tell  you  three or  four  things  in  regard  to  the  resur­ rected  body  i bat  are  beyond  guessing and  beyond  u p ta k e

In  the  first  place  I  rem ark  in  regard to  your  resm recteil  body,  it  will  be  a glorious  body. The  body we  have  now is  a  mere  skeleton  of  w hat  it  would have  been  if  sin  had  not  m arred  and defaced  it. Take  the  most  exquisite  ]  to  weep,  never statue  th a t was  ever  m ade  by  an  artist and  chip  it  here  and  chip  it  there  with a  chisel  and  batter  and  bruise  it  here and  there  and  then  stand  it  out  in  the storms  of  a  hundred  years,  and  the beauty  would  be  gone. Well,  the  hu­ man  body  has  been chipped  and bat­ tered  and  bruised  and  damaged  with the  storms  of  thousands  of  years-the physical  defects  of  other  generations coming  down  from  generation  to  gen-  ! eration,  we  inheriting  the  infelicities j of  past  generations. But  in  the  morn­ ing  of  the  resurrection  the  body  will be  adorned  and  beautified  according  to  I tho  original  model. And  there  is  no  ! such  difference  between  a  gymnast and  | an  emaciated  wretch  in  a  lazaretto  as thero  will  be  a  differenec  between  our bodies  as  they  are  now  and  our  resur­ rected  forms. There  you  will  see  the perfect  eye  after  tho  w aters  of  death have  washed  out  the  stains  ot tears and  study.  There  you  will  see  the  per­ fect  hand  after  the  knots  of  toll  have been  untied  from  the  knuckles.  There you  will  see  the  form  erect  and  elastic after  the  burdens  have  gone  off  the shoulder-the  very  life  of  God  in  the body. In  this  world  the  most  impres­ sive  thing,  the  most  expressive  thing, is  tne human  face,  b ut  th at  face is veil­ ed  with  the  griefs  of  a  thousand  years. But  in  the  resurrection  morn  th at  veil will  be  taken  away  from  the  face,  and the  noonday  sun  is  dull  and  dim  and stupid  compared  with  the  outflamlng glories  of the countenances  of  the When  those  faces  of  the  rightaway l . eous,  those  resurrected  faces,  turn  to-  I ward  the  gate,  or  look  up  toward  the  '  ? o t/ throne,  it  will  be  like  the  dawning  of  : a  new  morning  on  the  bosom  of  ever-  j  *he  m ost day. 0   glorious,  resurrected lasting body!

I

But  I  remark,  also,  in  regard  to  that new  generations.  ;  body  which  you  are  to  get  in  tho  resurrection,  it  will  be  an  im portant  body. These  bodies  are  w asting  away.  Some­ body has  said  th a t  as  soon  as  we  begin to  live we  begin  to  die. Unless we keep  putting  the  fuel  into  the  furnace tho  furnace  dies  out. The  blood  ves­ sels  are  canals  taking  the  breadstuffs to  all  parts  of  the  sy3tem. We  must be  reconstructed  hour  by  hour,  day  by day Sickness and  death  are  at all times  trying Vo  get  th eir  pry  under  the  1  they  w lu  become  like  quadrupeds. tenement or to push us off the embank­ ment  of  the  grave. But,  blessed be  i God,  in  the  resurrection  we  will  get a body  immortal.  No  m alaria  in the  air,  I no cough, no  neuralgic twinge, no  ' rheumatic  pang, no  fluttering  of tho heart,  no  shortness  of  breath,  no am­ bulance,  no  dispensary,  no  hospital,  no invalid's  chair,  no  spectacles  to  ira-  I prove  tbe  dim  vision,  but  health,  im-  | mortal  health! O  ye  who  have  aches  ' and  pains  indescribable  this  morning,  ] ye  who are never  well,  ye  who  are  lac­ erated  with  physical  distress,  let  mo tell  you  of  the  resurrected  body,  free from  all  disease.  Im m ortal!  Immortal! F u n   a n d   r a l h o i o f   S in s   Sine.

## Iu  Hearerx.

Plenty  of  occupation  in  heaven. I suppose  Broadway, New  York,  in  the  j busiest  season  of  the  year  at  noonday  | is  not so busy  as heaven is all  the  time.  ; Grand  projects  of  mercy for other worlds. Victories to  be celebrated. The  downfall  of  despotism  on  earth  to be  announced.  Creat songs to  be  learn­ ed  and  sung. Great  expeditions  on , which  God  shall  send  forth  his  child­ ren.  Plenty  to do,  b u t no fatigue  If you are  seated  under  the  trees  of  life,  it will  not  be  to  rest,  b ut  to  talk  over with  some  old  comrade  old  times-the '  battles  where  you  fought  shoulder to shoulder.

1 Sometimes  in  this  world  we  feel  we |  would  like  to  have  such  a  body as ! that. There  is  so  much  work  to  be ■  done  for Christ,  there  are  so  many tears  to  bo  wiped  away,  there  are so many burdens  to  life,  there  is  so  mufli to  be  achieved for  Christ,  wcsome­ times  wish  that  from  the  first  of  Jan jary  to  the  last  of  December  we  cou) i toil  on  without  stopping  to  sleep  or lo  take  any  recreation  or  to  rest or even  to  take  food-th at  we  could  toll right  on  without  stopping  a  moment in  our  work  of commending Christ and heaven  to  all  the  people. But  we  all get  tired. It  is  a  ch aracteristic  of  the human  bod7 in this condition;  we must get  tired.

th a t  we  are  going  to  have  &  body  th a t will  never  grow  weary? O  glorious resurrection  day! Gladly  will  I  fling aside  th is  poor  body  of  sin  and  fling it into  the  tomb  if  at  thy  bidding  I shall  have  a  body  that  never  wearies. That  is  a  splendid  resurrection  hymn t h a t  wo  h ave  all  sung;

## So  Jesus  slept. God's  dying  Son

Passed  through  the  grave  and  bless­ ed  th e  bed.

Rest  here,  blest  saint,  till  from  his throne

The  m orning breaks to  pierce  the shade.

## T i l * RWen  Savior,

0   blessed  resurrection! Spcalt  out, sweet  flowers,  beautiful  flowers!  W hile you  tell of  a   risen   C hrist  tell  of the righteous  who  shall  rise. May  God  fill you  this  m orning  w ith  anticipation!

more  to part,  never 1  heard  of  a  father  and  son who among others  were  shipw m ked  at  sea. The  father  and  sou  climbed  into  tho rigging. The  father  held  on,  but  tho son  after  aw hile  lost  his  hold  on  the rigging  and  was  dashed  down. 1 he father  supposed  he  had  gone  hopeless­ ly  under  the  wave. The  next  day  tho father  was  brought  ashore  from  the rigging  in  an  exhausted  state  and  laid on a bed in  a fisherm an's hut, and after many  hours  had  passed  ho  came  to consciousness  and saw  lying beside him  on  the  sam e  bed  his  boy. Oh,  iuv friends,  w hat  a  glorious  thing  it  w ill be  if  we  w ake  up  at  last  to  find our loved  ones  beside  us,  coming  up  from the  sam e  plot  iu  th e  graveyard, coming up in  th e same  morning  light-the father  and  son  alive  forever,  all  tho loved  ones  alive  forever,  never  moro more  to  die.

May  the  God  of  peace  that  brought again  from  the  dead  our  Lord  Jesus, th a t great Shepherd  of the  sheep, through  the  blood  of  the  everlasting covenant  make  you  perfect  in  every good  work,  to  do  his  will,  and  \e t  the associations  of  this  m orning  transport our  thoughts to  th e  grander assem­ blage  before  the  throne. The  one  hun­ dred  and  forty  and  four  thousand and the  'g rea t  m ultitude  th a t  no  m an  can number,"  some of  our  best friends among  them,  we  after  awhile  to join the  m ultitude. Glorious  anticipation'

## Blest  are  the  saintft  beloved  of  God;

Washed are  their robes  in Jesus' blood. Brighter  than  angels,  lo,  they  shine, Their  w onders  splendid  and  sublime.

My soul  anticipates  the  day, Would stretch  her wings  and soar

To  aid  th e  song,  the  palm  to  bear. And bow, the  chief of  sinners,  there.

## CURIOUS  IDEAS  OF  CHINESE, l i e l l o f That Men  Should  N ot  R ob  A n Im alg  o f  M ilk*

A  curious  system   of  philosophy  re­ garding  eating  is  evolved  by  some  per­ sons,  but  th e  queerest  · anti-prunuuciamento  in  some  tim e  is  th at  published in  the  L oa  Chow  H erald  regarding  the use  by  m an  of anim al's milk. The eru­ dite  Chinese  who  edit  this  journal  of the  tw entieth  century  publish  a  procI  la m atio n   w h ich   says: "Man  should ' : , , : . ob  ' ^ l s o f   «»eir P " > P f al^ 0 al'  a ? im als>  th ®.  cow 3 t 0   T ? ' ^ lers  of  m ilk  blacken  their  souls for gain;  but  those  who  drink  milk  do  so in  th e  foolish  belief  th a t  it  is  good  for them. Before  taking  any  medicine,  we should  carefully  investigate  its  proper­ ties,  and who  does so  with milk? Milk  is  the natural  food  for babes and  of young  anim als;  but when  adults drink  it,  do  they  n o t  thereby  endanger the life  of  th e  suckling  calf,  and  arouse bitter  resentm ent  in  the  souls of  the calf  and  its  m other? Beasts  have  not the  power  of  speech,  and  so  cannot tell  m en  th a t  by  d rinking  cow's  m ilk If men must have a strengthening draught,  there are  a  thousand  better things  th a n   m ilk,  so  why  sleet th a t? Besides,  th e  term   of  life  is  foreordain­ ed  and i t cannot be prolonged by drinking  m ilk. Everyone  who  reads this  w arning  is  especially  enjoined  to abstain  from   m ilk  in  the  future  Child­ ren  whose  parents  will  not  allow them to  d rin k   millc  w ill  n o t  be  stunted  in growth,  b u t  they  w ill  have  their  lives prolonged and be Immune in epidemics. So  it  is  proclaim ed  In  the  Hall  of Good  Counsel.'

Of  all  griefs,  probably  those  are  the hardest  to  bear  which,  while  real  and I  serious  to  tho  people  who  suffer  them , are  of  a  kind  to  excite  unsym pathetic smiles  in  everybody  else. So  it  is  no wonder  th a t  the  residents  of  Sing  Sing are  eager  to  change  the  plcturcsque name of  th e ir  village. They  know  per­ fectly  well  th a t  to  the  outside  world Sing  Sing m eans  a  big prison,  and  they have  w earied  of  the  jests  to  which  the identification  of  the  title  and  the  in sti­ tution  exposes  them . So  they  w ant  to say  th a t  th e y   live  in  Ossining  instead of  in  S ing  Sing,  and  the  desire  is  n a t­ ural  enough. But,  unfortunately,  it is  also  fu n n y   and  possibly  it  would  be wiser  to  endure  th eir  present  ill  than to  b rin g   th e ir   sensitiveness  to  general attention  by  taking  action  for  relief. And  how  long  would  it  be,  moreover, before  th e  prison  association  fastened itself  upon  O ssining? What Sing sing wants  to  do  is  tc   grow  so  big  th a t  it can  w in  recognition  for  itself There Is  no  o th e r  cure  for  its  woes,  but  a cultivation  of  a  philosophical  indif­ ference  will  do  m uch  to  m itigate  them , as  it  w ill  fo r  m ost  other  woes.-New York  Times.

Now. around  this  doctrine  of the  res­ urrection  there  are  a  great  m any  mysir-rits. You  come  to  ms  and  say.  If th e   bodies  of  the  dead  are  to  be  raised, how  is  this  and  ho-.v  Is  th a t'' Anl you  ask  me  a  thousand  questions  I  am incompetent  to  answer But  there  are a  g reat  many  things  you  believe  th at you  are  not  able to explain. You would  be  a  very  foolish  m an  to  say, ' I don't  believe  anything  I  can't  un- ! d e r s l a n d " Why,  putting  down  one 1 kind  of  flower  seed,  comes  there  up ' t h i s   flower  of  this  color? Why,  put­ tin g   down  another  flower  seed,  comes th e re   up  a  flower  of  this  color? One flower white, another flower yellow,  an­ other  flower crimson. Why the differ­ ence  when  the  seeds  look  to  be  very much  alike-are  very  much  alik e''  Ex­ plain these things  Explain th a t  w art on th e   finger. Explain  the  difference  why t h e   oak  leaf  is  different  from  th e  leaf of  th e  hickory. Tell  me  how  the  Lord Almighty  can  turn  the  chariot  of-his omnipotence  on  a  rose  leaf. You  ask me  questions  about  the  resurrection  I cannot answer.  I  will  ask  you  a   thoupand  questions  about everyday  life  you cannot  answer.

## Significance  o f  u  Oreaf.  Found.

You have noticed,  I suppose,  in  read­ in g   th e  story  of  tne  resurrection  th a t alm ost every account of the Bible  giv3» the  idea  that  the  characteristic  of  that day  will  be  a  great  sound. I do  n jt know  that  it  will  be  very  loud,  bu I  know   it  will  be  very  penetrating. In t h e mausoleum where silence has reigned  a  thousand  years  th a t  voice must  penetrate. In  tbe  coral  cave  of th e deep  that  voicf  must  penetratu Millions  of  spirits  ivill  come  through t h e gates  of  eternity,  and  they  will come  to  lite  tombs  of  the  earth,  and t h e y   w ill  cry,  'Give  us  back  our  bod-
