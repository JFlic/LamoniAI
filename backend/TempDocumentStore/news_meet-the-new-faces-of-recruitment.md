The Graceland Enrollment team recently announced new members to its graduate and adult admissions team.Barbie Bellwas promoted to director of graduate and adult admissions after previously working as an Admissions Representative for Graceland. Bell served as a recruiter for ITT Technical Institute for eight years prior to joining Graceland University. Her experience and knowledge in the graduate and adult learning space has been an asset to Graceland since 2018, and she will continue to offer leadership in her new role. Bell has been working quickly to fill out her team and announced some additional changes.

Jamie Pressler, who previously served as an administrator for the Independence Campus nursing and Seminary programs, was promoted to an admissions representative and will recruit for several programs, including Graceland’s Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), post-graduate certifications, the popular Master of Science in Nursing, and the Community of Christ Seminary master’s programs. Doug Roberts ’02 has also been hired as an admissions representative to work with RN-BSN, RN– MSN, and health care students. While at Graceland, Roberts was on the men’s basketball team, House President of Closson, and active in student life. “Graceland provided me with many positive life experiences; it was a place I learned about myself and the world and was a great place to get an education. I am excited to join the admissions team and help more students get that opportunity,” said Roberts. The role of admission representatives is to recruit for their specific programs, travel locally and internationally representing Graceland and the opportunities for graduate and adult learners.

Over on the Lamoni campus, Dustan Guider ’19 was promoted from admission intern to admissions counselor and will be recruiting for baseball, softball, men’s and women’s basketball, cheer, dance, and golf. During his time at Graceland, Guider was the house president of Faunce; he has vast experience in fostering relationships with new students and building community in his work environment.

“The new faces of the recruitment team will advance our team’s mission and bring even more exceptional students to our academic programs,” saidDeb Skinner, Vice President for Enrollment and Strategic Growth.
