Karen is a socially engaged artist and educator. As an educator, she teaches all levels of studio art, including social engagement, and art history. As an artist, she loves to help keep traditions and stories alive by encouraging communities to listen and learn from each other.

She is a native West Virginian with a heart for Appalachia, spending her summers adventuring, painting murals, archiving stories, and working with the West Virginia Governor’s Honors Academy.

I love long distance adventure! I’ve thru-hiked the entire Appalachian Trail, walked the Camino de Santiago across Spain, I’ve ridden my mountain bike from Mexico to Canada on the Continental Divide, and biked across the country from Oregon to Virginia.
