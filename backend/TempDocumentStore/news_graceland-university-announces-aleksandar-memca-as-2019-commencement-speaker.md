Lamoni, Iowa — Graceland University is pleased to announce that Aleksandar Memca ’00 will share the commencement address for the Spring 2019 Commencement ceremony to be held Sunday, April 28, in the Eugene E. and Julia Travis Closson Physical Education Center in Lamoni, Iowa.

Memca is a managing partner and principal advisor at a number of companies. He is a technology thought-leader and entrepreneur with deep experience in enterprise architecture, service-oriented computing, research and development, software design, and deployment of highly complex, real-time applications and platforms.

Memca has worked closely with industry-leading CEOs and numerous Fortune 500 CIOs – both in the U.S. market as well as globally. He has driven and led the enterprise technology direction for companies such as AT&T, Perficient, Enron and Cricket Wireless, and has spearheaded many highly visible software projects, including the first launch of the Apple iPhone and the first wireless local number portability implementation.

Memca holds a Bachelor of Science in computer science, computer engineering and management of information systems with a minor in mathematics from Graceland, and he is an active alumnus. Memca came to the United States in 1999 permanently from his native city of Bitola, Macedonia, and often travels around the world and spends a significant amount of time in Macedonia, where he believes in the human capital potential of the local community.

An avid investor and philanthropist, Memca is always on the lookout for the next big business opportunity and ways to help those in need. Together with his wife, Elizabeta Velevska ‘00 Memca, also a Graceland alumna, Memca is involved in many philanthropical projects, mainly focused on improving the lives of children in the couple’s birth town of Bitola. They now live in San Diego, California, with their two children, Veronika and Gabriel.

Graceland is thrilled to welcome Aleksandar back to Lamoni to share his wisdom with this year’s graduates.
