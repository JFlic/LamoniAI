Graceland University Vice President for Enrollment Management Scott Briell is pleased to announce the recent hiring of Emily Munter as the Community of Christ Outreach Specialist. Munter will begin her new role Oct. 1.

Munter has a strong background and ties to Community of Christ (seventh generation) and graduated from Graceland University in 2008 (fifth generation) with a Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education. She then went on to obtain endorsements in middle school and special education from McKendree University in Illinois and has held positions in both the education and marketing fields, setting her up to be a perfect fit for this position on the Lamoni campus.

“I believe this position asks for someone to leverage the connection between Graceland University and the Community of Christ membership to benefit (bless) future generations,” shared Munter. “I’m willing to take that step because I believe in what the position is called to do: train and encourage others to be champions for Graceland within Community of Christ and start them on a path that will forever change their lives.”

Graceland welcomes Emily Munter back to the Lamoni campus – this time as an employee and representative of how Community of Christ values weave throughout the Graceland experience to touch the lives of our students.
