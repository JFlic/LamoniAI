Peter Mark Hamann, internationally renowned potter, will visit Lamoni, Iowa, Tuesday, Sept. 22. Hamann will give an artist talk and pottery demonstration at 6 p.m. in the Ceramics Studio in The Helene Center for the Visual Arts at Graceland University. The event is free and the public is encouraged to attend.

Peter Hamann has been a resident of Japan for more than 30 years, although he was born in Nebraska and first studied ceramics in the United States. Upon his arrival in Japan, he learned about ceramics and was introduced to “chanoyu,” or the Japanese tea ceremony. His creation of ceramics is strongly connected to his tea ceremony practice; Hamann believes that the appreciation and respect for objects of quality that chanoyu teaches is an important aspect of Japanese culture. He also believes in the practical utility of the vessels he creates.

Hamann specializes in refined, carved porcelain works. His works have been recognized at juried shows such as the Traditional Japanese Art Crafts exhibitions. In 1996, he joined the prestigious Japan Art Crafts Association and remains its only Western member. – information from Onishi Gallery

Come join us to share Hamann’s talents and skills and watch a master potter at work. For questions, please call Julia Franklin, Graceland University Art Department Coordinator, at 641-784-5329.
