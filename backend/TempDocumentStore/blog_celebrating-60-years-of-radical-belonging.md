“ Everyone who is here belongs here just because they are here, and for no other reason. This is our top rule. It depends on nothing else. Nothing changes it.”

GRACELAND UNIVERSITY HOUSE PHILOSOPHY

In the spring of 1962, the Civil Rights Movement was sweeping across the United States and there was a sense on Graceland’s campus that social clubs on campus were causing divisiveness amongst the student body. Graceland made the decision to completely reorganize the campus social setting and residence life with the goal of unifying the campus through more inclusive social activities for students. Harvey Grice, Graceland’s President at the time, asked the Council of Student Life (CSL) to study the campus, conduct student polls, and hold all campus meetings. The CSL determined that the numerous campus social clubs were too exclusionary to promote the type of student life that Graceland wanted after becoming a 4-year institute in the mid 1950s. Social clubs came to an end at the conclusion of the 1961-62 academic year.

In a special session held Monday, May 7, 1962, the faculty approved the CSL’s proposal for campus reorganization. The new system was primarily designed by Director of Housing Dave Haseltine, Dean of Students Harold Condit, and the Student Body President Jennings Jay Newcom, based on a model used by Grinnell College. Alongside others, Haseltine, Condit, and Newcom spearheaded the development of a new housing system which was approved to be implemented in the fall of 1962 for that academic year, and the house system Graceland holds dear was born.

In the fall of 1962, 15 houses were established, seven men’s houses, seven women’s, and a last hall for married students. Each house had 45-67 students, a faculty member to act as a sponsor, and an elected student council to manage any house social activities and housing issues that came up among members. This council originally included a House President, Vice President/Treasurer, Vice President/Secretary, Chaplain, two Senators, and an Intramurals or Women’s Recreation Association representative.

At the beginning of the 1962-63 school year, house members organized to elect positions and propose house names to be approved. House members also chose their own insignias, colors, mottos, and crests, all of which had to be submitted to Lance Hutton, the Council of House Presidents Vice President. Many of them still exist today.

Some houses have kept their histories and trivia veiled in secret, not to be easily recorded by the history books. The following listing of houses is what our investigative team could find over the years.

Aaron’s homecoming sidewalk rope “climb” tradition across campus, first staged in 1979.

AARON 1962-2012

HOUSE MASCOTKnightsCOLORSBlack, White, and RedNAME ORIGINAfter the Aaronic priesthood of the Community of Christ (then RLDS) churchFIRST HOUSE PRESIDENTJames WarnockTRIVIAAaron’s knightly origins date back to a social club called the K.O.G. (Knights of Graceland) that began in 1946-47. The K.O.G. passed on their knightly paraphernalia to Aaron. K.O.G. also contributed the idea and the labor for the big concrete G that is visible from the football stands. Aaron House members were easy to identify on campus because of their iconic red jackets, introduced in 1977-78 and designed by Brian Carr.

Married students also maintained a newsletter, originally called The Ball and Chain, a shoutout to the original married social club, which was formed in 1945.

Over the years, many houses have been created, merged, or ended for many different reasons (new buildings, building conversions, changes in enrollment, etc.). Below is a listing of the houses that have existed at one time or another during Graceland’s history.

One of the time-honored traditions of the house system is the painting of the Victory Bell. The bell originally hung in the chapel of the Higdon Administration Building before moving to the area just southeast of the building in the fall of 1959.

The painting of the bell originally required students to shimmy up a large concrete and stone tower. In 2015, the bell was moved to its current location just east of the Fitzgerald Fitness Center, thanks in part to the efforts of the facility services team of Bob Kelly, Rob Washburn, and Nathan Craig, whose creativity made the bell visible and easily accessible.

Painting the bell is very much a source of pride for many of the houses. Alumni house members have been known to “claim the bell” upon visits to campus for Homecoming or other activities.

The Air Band contest was introduced by COSA in 1984 as an annual competition between the houses. Houses are paired up and perform a lip synched, choreographed stage routine to popular songs. Originally, the event was held in the spring, replacing Spring Sing, which involved live singing.

Over the years, Air Band moved to be held on Homecoming weekend and became a part of the annual Homecoming house competition. Costumes, routines, and themes became more and more elaborate. Now, houses select a movie that they must portray through their performance, using contemporary songs.

At Homecoming 2022, defending Air Band champions Sariah teamed with Stewart Manor to perform the winning routine, their energetic and well-choreographed interpretation of Finding Nemo.

This academic school year marks the 60th year of the house system being in place at Graceland and despite years of changes, disbandings, and merges many of the original names are still in use. Ultimately, the house system is built upon the belief that students can find belonging and inclusion at Graceland. The residence life system embraces the idea that our students will become their best selves if they can find a strong support system. Over the years, Graceland’s houses have seen a lot of change, but their commitment to ensuring students feel a sense of welcome the moment they arrive on campus has remained steadfast.

We love hearing your memories of the house system! If you have others you’d like to share, don’t hesitate to email them tohousehistory@graceland.edu.
