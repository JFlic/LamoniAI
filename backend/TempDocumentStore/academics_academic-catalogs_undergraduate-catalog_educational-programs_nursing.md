The Nursing curriculum is carefully designed to integrate professional education with liberal arts and sciences. The program accommodates students beginning their education in nursing as well as students eligible for advanced placement. Graduates are prepared to provide nursing care in hospital and community health settings where beginning professional competence is expected.

The Nursing Programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nurse Education (CCNE) (https://www.aacnnursing.org/CCNE) and are fully approved by the Iowa Board of Nursing, and the Missouri State Board of Nursing.

In accordance with Missouri requirements (Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 335.046; 20 CSR 2200-4.020,1D) completion of the Graceland BSN degree does not guarantee eligibility to write the licensure examination since all applicants must be approved by the Board and have completed at least the high school course of study, or the equivalent thereof as determined by the State Board of Education, as well as the basic professional curriculum at Graceland. A complete copy of the State of Missouri Nursing Practice Act 335.066 can be obtained from the Missouri State Board of Nursing. A resource for information regarding tuition, fees, and length of program is: Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, 655 K Street, NW, Suite 750, Washington, DC 20001, 202-887-6791.

Successful achievement in the humanities is basic to understanding the whole person and his/her response in health and illness. The well-prepared high school student usually spends four academic years completing the requirements for the Nursing major. The freshman and sophomore years are spent on the Lamoni campus, where the student enrolls in supporting science and humanities courses.* The nursing courses are taught on the Independence Campus in Independence, Missouri. The first three nursing courses are taught the summer before the junior year. Students will go to a variety of health care agencies for hands-on clinical experience while simultaneously completing the general education and Nursing major requirements.

*Transfer students may take these courses at other colleges.
