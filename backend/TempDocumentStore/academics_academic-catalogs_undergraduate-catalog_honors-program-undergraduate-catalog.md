Application for admission to the Honors Programmay be made upon admission to the university or anytime during a student’s college career provided they plan to remain active in the Honors program for a minimum of two full years. Successful applicants are normally expected to meet both of the following criteria:

The Honors Council is, however, free to admit other students who present alternative evidence of exceptional academic promise. Students interested in admission to the program but for whom ACT or SAT scores are low or not available are urged to consult with the program director.

A major scholarly paper or senior project planned by the honors student and executed in consultation with an approved faculty member. To count toward an honors degree, the student must receive a grade of A or B. The thesis/project will be evaluated on the basis of its originality, quality of research, and presentation. A prospectus must be approved by the Honors Council before significant work is begun. The subject of the thesis/project may be outside the student’s major and may be interdisciplinary in scope. Prerequisites: Senior standing and admission to the Honors Program.

Interdisciplinary first-year seminar provides a common intellectual experience for new Honors students and introduces them to the culture and opportunities of a small liberal arts institution. Designed to help exceptional students produce, deliver, and, analyze written and oral texts and learn how written and oral performances function together in specific discourse communities. Substitutes for Discourse I. Admission by selection only. ELO1A Communication, GE1B Foundational Skills-Writing and Communication.

The second of two sequenced interdisciplinary Honors seminars focused on developing the skills of written and oral communication, critical inquiry, and research. Students produce, deliver, and analyze college-level written and oral texts based on sustained academic research, and continue to develop their understanding of critical discourse analysis and critical language awareness in the context of a range of discursive forms (written, oral, visual and/or multimedia). Reinforces the common intellectual experience of the Honors program and further exposes students to the culture and opportunities of a small liberal arts institution. Admission by selection only. Substitutes for Discourse II. Prerequisite: HONR1010. ELO1B Communication, GE1A Foundational Skills-Writing and Communication.

Student-driven course designed to explore and develop the unique skill of curiosity.  Students who are intellectually curious ask big question, explore diverse topics, and value learning for its own sake, always seeking to understand how and why things are the way they are.  Also a predictor of academic success, curiosity is an important trait that employers seek, since exploring alternatives and being adaptable best prepares someone for a rapidly changing world.

Each participant is required to prepare specified readings in advance of weekly sessions and to share in planning and conducting discussions. Offered in the fall semester only.
