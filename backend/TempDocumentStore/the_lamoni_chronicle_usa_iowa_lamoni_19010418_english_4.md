'1 he  question  of law involved  is  w h e th e r  th e  acts  m aking t h e appropriations were repealed when  the  new  code  went  into  effect. The  regents made requisition  for ■£■5,000  due  th e last quarter  of  ISO" in  accordance  w ith  an  act  providing fo r  th e   endow m ent  and  support  of th e   'u n iv e rsity , passed  in  1S7S;  for ?2,0S3.:n, being  a  p a rt  of  the  an­ nual appropriation  for  endowment and  support  m ade  by  the  Twentyand  support  m ade  by  an  act  of  the Twenty-fiftli  g eneral  assembly,  and fo r  $1,041.67,  a  p a r t  of  th e   annual  ap­ propriation  for  endowment  and  sup­ p o r t made by th e Twenty-sixth general  assem bly.

Kaslon,  a   w ea lth y banker  of  Deeorah,  m ust  serve  live years  in  th e   s la te   p e n ite n tia ry   on  a charge  of  fraudulent  banking. The suprem o  court  of  Iowa  has  affirm ed th e decision  of  the  F a je tte   county court,  -which  sentenced  E aston  to   th e t e r m   s la te d .

Easton  w as  president  of  th e   F irs t National  bank  of  Decorali  and  for several years  had  been  a  w ealthy man  of  th a t  city. August  21,  1S9G, he  received  a   deposit  of  $100. Aftcx-ward,  on  November  10  of  tb e   sam e year,  a  receiver  was  appointed  for tlio  bank,  and  because  of  th e   $100 deposit  lie  w as  indicted  upon  th e charge  of  having  received  th e   deposit a f t e r   t h e   b a n k   w as  know n  to   b e  in ­ solvent. He  was  convicted  on  the charge  and  appealed  the  case.

I t - w a s   claim ed  in  the  ap p eal  th a t the  law   re la tin g   to  E asto n 's  crim e does  n o t  apply  to national banks, which  are  organized  under  national laws,  and  th a t  Easton's  b an k   w as n o t  am enable  to   th e  sta te  la w s;  an d f u r t h e r   t h a t   if  held  lo  be  so  th e   a c t was  xmconstitutional.

The suprexxxe  court has decided  th a t t h e   b a n k in g   law   u n d er  w hieli  E a s to n was  convicted  clearly  applies  to  n a­ tio n a l  b a n k s . On  the  question  as  to whether  the  law  is  constitutional  tbe suprem e  court  follows  the  ru lin g s  as laid  down  by  the  United  S tates  su­ preme  court.

## the  Canal  Question

New  Orleans,  April  15.-Judge  P arlangc. in the  United  States  circuit court  lias  handed  down  a  decision dismissing  th e  su it  brought  by  th e Boer  representatives  here  to  prevent x*.c shipm ent  of  m ules  atul  horses out  of  New  O rleans  to  the  B ritish ·army  in  South  A frica. The  decision is  a  le n g th y   one.

Judge  l'urlangc holds th a t th e transactions  betw een  citizens  of  the United  S tates  and  th e  British  governme/it  w ere  conducted  under the  order of  private  citizenship  -nnd  th a t  the courts  had  absolutely  no  jurisdiction to  in te rfe re . The  horses  and  mules, the  court  said,  w ere  bought  in  a neutral  te rrito ry . Judge Parlange continues:

'If  the  c o m p lain an ts  could be heard to assert  here  rig h ts  personal to themselves  iii'th e   tre a ty   invaded  and if  tho  m ules  and  horses  involved  in th is   cause  a re   m u n itio n s  of  w ar,  all of  which  is  disputed  by  the  defend­ ants,  it  would  become  necessary  to determ ine  w hether  the  United  States intended  by  the  declaration  of  th e tre a ty   (of  W ashington.  May  S.  1871), to  subvert  th e  w ell  established  p rin ­ ciple  of  in te rn a tio n a l  law  th a t  th e private  citizens  of  a  neutral  nation can  law fully  sell  supplies  to  bellig­ erents.

'i t is alm ost impossible' to  sup­ pose  a  p rio ri,  th a t  th e  United  S ta te s would  have  done  so  and  would  have thus  provided  for  the  most  serioxts and  extensive  dei-angemejit  of  and injury  to  the  com m erce  of  our  citi­ zens,  w hether  tw o  or  more  foreign nations  should  go  to  war;  and  it would  seem "that  th ere  was  nothing in  the  tre a ty ,  especially  when  its  h is­ tory  and  purposes are considered, which  would  w arra n t  the  belief  th a t the  Ur.ited  S tates  insisted  xipon  in­ sertin g   th e re in a new  principle  of in te rn a tio n a l law'  from which  the g r e a te s t  d a m a g e   m ig h t  resu lt  to   th e commerce  of  this  country  and  which the  government,  of  this  country  has heretofore  strenuously  and  invari­ ably  followed.

## CATTLE  INDUSTRY  IS  HIT

## Britsh Army  to  Be  Fed Home* Grown  Beef.

Washington,  Apx-il  32.-The  depart­ ment  of  agriculture  h as  received  a dispatch  from   a  prom inent  packingcompany  of  Chicago,  announcing th a t they  have  just  been  ad i ised  th a t  the English  governm ent  h as  excluded  all, beef except  home  bred  from  the  B rit­ ish  arm y  contracts. This,  it  is  s ta t­ ed,  is  to   be  effective  J u n e   1  next.

The  ( hicago  concern  has  asked  the agricultural  departm ent  for  any  as­ sistance  it  can  re n le r. It,  is  pointed out that  Ihe  action  of  th e   B ritish gov­ ernment  is a  severe  blow  to  American beef  nnd  cattle  ex p o rte rs  and  pro-i ducers,  and  nunns  n o t  aloue  the  loss in  government  trade,  but  it  is  feared it  will  serve  very  m a teria lly   tow ard inciting  a  prejudice  on  the  p art  of Great  Britain  ag ain st  th e  beef  and cattle  of  this  co u n try .

No  official  confirm ation  of  this  re­ ported contem plated move has reached  the  d ep artm en t,  according  to statem ents  of  officials. Steps  have! been  taken,  however,  looking  to  ac­ quiring  whatever  inform ation  it  is possible  to  get. <

To  dem onstrate  th e   im portance  of the  move  contem plated,  it  is  pointed out  th a t  th e  value  of  o u r  exports  of live  anim als  to   G reat  B rita in   am ounts to  $40,000,000,  while  th e   to ta l  of  ani­ mal  products  exported  from   the U nit­ ed  S lates  to   .Ire a t  B rita in   is  sta te d to  be,  in  round  n u m b ers,  $200,000,000. It  is  pointed  out.  h e re   th a t  th is  p ro ­ posed  embargo  may  really  bo  a  se­ quel,  in  g re a te r  o r  le s s   degree,  to  tho proceedings  in stitu te d a t New  Or­ leans  against  shipm ent  of  horses  and mules  from  th a t  p o rt  fo r  use  in  the SottHi  African  cam paign. While  this is,  of  course,  m erely  conjectural,  it  is very  strongly  hinted  th a t  the  New Orleans  incident  probably  is  the  d i­ rect  inspiration  for  th e   step. I t is pointed  out  th a t  if  th e   B ritish  really decided  to  take th e  actio n   reported  in the  advises  just,  received,  they  m ight t u r n   to   A u s tra lia   f o r   t h e i r   m eats. Is is  claim ed,  however,  th a t  m eats  can­ not  be  g o tte n   th e re   in  a s  good  qual­ i t y nor  as  cheap as  in  the  United States.
