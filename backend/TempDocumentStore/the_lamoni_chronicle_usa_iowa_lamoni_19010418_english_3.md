CHAPTER  VII.

To Clarice she vowed  a redoubled de­ votion. Ah!  if  any caro  of  hers  might help  her  towards  recovery, so that when  her  lover  returned  from   his  In­ dian  campaign  she might 'be well enough  to  marry! Only  in  helping  to bring th a t  m arriage  to  a   successful  is»ue  could  she  hope  to  efface  the  last miserable  half-hour. She  would  try, ioo, and talk to Doctor D rake some  day by  herself,  and  ask  it a n y possible change  of  treatm ent m ig h t hasten Clarice's  recovery. The  very  thought brought  comfort  and  hope  w ith  it.

Having  decided  her  course  of  action, the  proceeded  to  put  it  in to   practice; smoothed  her  hair,  and  trie d   to   wash the  traces of tears from h er  face. Then the  sat  down  and  wrote  a  few   lines  to her 'brother,  declining  to  le n d   him   the money, and giving him  her  reasons for the  refusal. After  th a t  sh e  w ent  to Clarice's room,  who, happily,  she  found ilone.

'I thought you  were  never  com ing!' laid  Clarice  fretfully. 'Come  and  sit tlose  by  me  where  I  can  see  you. I need  your  soothing  presence  so  badly to-day.  Why,  what  is  the  m a tte r  with rou,  dear? You  look  as  if  y o u   needed toothing yourself. Yo\ have been cry­ ing,  and  I  thought  you  were  a   woman who  could  not  cry."

Janetta  gave  rather  a  w atery  smile. "You were wrong, you see.  I have been In  trouble  about  several  th in g s,  an d   I iould  not see  my  way  clear; b u t   I   see It now.  I  shan't  cry  any m ore,  I  prom ­ ise  you.' And Janetta  threw   back her Head with something of her usual  frank reliance.

Clarice glanced at her wistfully. "You are  reserved  and proud,  Ja n e tta ; but  If  It  were  a   case where money would  help----- '

With  quick  alertness  Ja n etta  bent down  and  kissed  one  of  Clarice's  tiny, helpless  hands.

'Ah!  how  good  and  dear  you  are; but  It  is  not .a  case  of  money. I   a m almost  glad  not  to  have  It,  because  I might  do  harm  instead  of  good  w ith it.'

' Not  my hands, my face,'  said Clarice  simply. And  Janetta  b e n t  and Kissed  her  on  the  forehead,  oppressed with  a  sense  of her  own  unw orthineas.

The  day  passed  liko  a  dream. She saw  Captain  Merivale  only  a t  m eals, for  he  and  Clarice  spent  the  evening alone  together.

Tho  next  day,  when  he  came  dow n after  bidding  her  good-by,  he  found Mrs.  Mortimer  standing  alone  in   th e hall,  giving  her  last  directions  fo r  th e ,packlng  of  his  luggage  into  th e  c a r­ riage. He  looked  searchingly  ab o u t for  Janetta.

'Miss  Howard  desired  me  to  bid  you good-by  for  her,'  said  Mrs.  M ortim er, answering  his  glance. "She  w ent  in to the  tow n  for  something.'

'Oh, thank you.  Tell  her I was so rry toot  to  see  her. You  and  she  will  lo o k utter  Clarice  for  me  w hilst  I'm  aw ay, Won't  you?'

The  next  instant  he  w.-'.j  gone. J a ­ netta,  meanwhile,  sought  shelter  in   a iittle cove  by  the  seashore,  and  sa t With  her  back  against  the  cliff,  an d tier  tearless  eyes  gazing  out  seaw ards.

Her  teeth  were  clenched  in  the  ef­ fort  to  keep 'back  the  sobs  th a t rose  in her  th ro at. She  would  gladly  have aprooted  this  strange  love  that  h ad grown  up  in.  her  heart,  but  she  could tot.

'He's  gone  now,'  she  said,  pulling jut  h er  watch  and  looking,  at  it. ' I t lan't  toe  wrong  to  go  on  loving  him frhen  I   sh all  never  see  him  again. I t :an  n eith er  hurt  him  nor  me,  for  he Joes  n o t  know  it;  and  God  knows  I 4ave  b u t  one  great  wish  in  life  left  to ne-that he and Clarice should m arry.'

I t chanced  that  on  her  way  home ihe  came  across  Doctor  Drake w alking juickly  down  the  street. He  would have  passed  her  by  with  a  bow,  but Ihe  cafhe  to  a  stop.

'There is something I wanted to talk to  you  about. Could  you  spare  me  a minute?'

''C ertainly,"  he  said,  w ith  a   slight lurprise.

"I  never  get  the  chance  of  a   word ilone  w ith  you. Will  you  forgive  me if  I  a s k   If  th e re   is  n o th in g   th a t  could be  done  to  hasten  Miss  Seymour's  re ­ covery?'

Doctor  D rake's  fair  face  flushed.  'I t Is  a   q uestion .that  is  often  before  me. Do  you  th in k   her  worse?"  he  asked anxiously.

'She  Is  out  of  spirit*,  and  losing hope.'

'Of  w hat?'  Inquired  the  Doctor  im ­ patiently. 'Of  recovery  or  w hat?'

'Of  everything  that  makes  her  life worth  living. Until  she  ls  better  she will  not  m arry.'

'Or Captain  Merivale will not m arry her!"  broke  out  the  Doctor. 'Which Is  It,  do  you  think? You  arc  speaking frankly to me,  Miss Howard,  and  I can -but  answer  you  in  the  same  spirit.  No specialist  can  do  anything  for  Miss Seymour. I will  tell  you  briefly  my opinion,  w hich  is  backed by  other  men in my profession.  When Miss Seymour was thrown from  her horse  she severe­ ly  strained  th e  nerves  of  the  spine.

"As  far  as  we  can  discover,  the  in­ jury  Is  entirely  overcome; but  her '   whole  nervous  system is shattered. When  that  recovers  its  tone  she  will be  well. I t   lie s   m uch  with  herself and those  about  her. That'is  why  I  ad­ vised  cheerful  companionship  of  a  girl ·bout  her  own  age. I 've  known  sim­ i l a r   cases. Sometimes a sudden  neces> ity   for  exertion  will,  cure  a-p atien t, r   a   great  happiness; If  I had;.b«en tain  Merivale' I  shoulS hare-tried

the  happiness-I  should  have  married her  before  now.'

J a n e tta   g ave  him   a  quick  look  of sympathy.

''You  think  It  m ight have cured her?'

'I  should  have  tried  it,'  replied  the Doctor  (fUletly.

"But  If  it  h ad n 't,  how  m iserable  she would  have <been.'

'It would be  the fault ot her husband if  she  were  so,'  replied  the  Doctor, with  rath er  an  odd  little  smile.

"Poor  fellow!"  thought  Janetta,  'he cares  for  her  him self. What a  strong, tender  nature  he  has  hidden  behind th a t  cold  m anner.'

'Then  I  can  do  nothing,'  she  said aloud,  'and  I  wish  to  do  so  m uch! I would  do  anything  that  lay  in  my power  to  help  m ake  her  well.'

For  the  first  tim e  Doctor  D rake  re­ garded  her  attentively. There  was  no doubt  of  the  sincerity  of  the  speaker.

'You  can  do  much,''  he  said  kindly. 'Help  her  to  forget  herself,  keep  her bright  and  cheerful;  and  if,  by  w hole­ some contradiction,  you could  trick her into doing  a  little  morff,  you  would  be of  real  service.'

They both  laughed,  for Clarice's way­ wardness  was  apparent  to  every  one that  came  Into  contact  with  her;  and Janetta remembered how  often  she had  come  down  stairs,  or went  out  for a  drive,  in  opposition  to  the  expressed wish  of  the  Doctor.

'I  am  glad  you  spoke  to  me,'  he said,  holding  out  his  hand. 'I  feel  as if  we  had  come  to   a b etter understand­ ing.'  *

His  last  sentence  was  overheard  by Mrs.  Mortimer, who  advanced  with cat­ like  tread  down  the  street. She  did not  stop,  only  bowed  to  the  pair  who seemed  absorbed  in  such  earnest  con­ versation, w ith  a rath e r  meaning smile, ana  passed  over  to  the  other  &ide  of the  street.

"The chit!  the deceitful  chit!  So  th a t is  the  business  th a t  took  her  out  in such  a  hurry  this  morning! She  is determined  to  have  more than one string  to  h er  bow. I  wonder  what  tho better  understanding  may  be?'  said Mrs.  Mortimer  under  her  breath,  s'.s she  looked  after'  Ja n etta's  retreating figure.

After t h a t conversation  with  the Doctor,  Jan etta  redoubled  her efforts to brighten  Clarice's  life.

'I  feel  your  wings  about  me  night and  day,"  said  Clarice,  sm iling  at  her. 'Didn't  I  hear  you  crRpp  into  my  room in  the  middle  of  the  n ig h t?'

'Yes,' Janetta confessed.  'I  thought I  heard  you  move,  and  th a t  I  might put  you  oil  to  sleep  again  by  reading aloud.'

'Do  you  sleep  w ith  your  door  open, then?'  asked  Clarice.

Janetta  laughed  and  nodded.

'I  like  to  be  close  a t  hand if you want  me.' o

"But  how  can  I  repay  devotion  like yours?  You  will  stay  w ith  me  always, Janetta?"

'Until  you  m arry,  if  you  wish  it.' 'And  when  will  th at  be,  I  wonder?' said  Clarice,  w ith  a  quick  sigh.

'When Captain Merivale comes home  again,'  Janettai  replied.

'It's  ju st  th a t  decided  w ay  of  yours th a t  keeps  hope  alive.'

They  were  siting ln  the drawing room alter dinner. Mrs.  Mortimer had  gone  up  stairs  to  w rite  letters. A violent  ring  a t  th e  bell  m ade  the  girls look  at  each  other  in  quick  surprise.

'A  caller  a t  th is  tim e  in  the  even­ ing?"  said  Clarice. 'Just  tell  Mason t h a t   unless  it  Is  Doctor  D rake  I  can see  nobody.'

There  was  only  tim e  to  issue  the order  before  Mason  reached  the  door, and  then  a  m an's  voice  w as heard speaking  in  the  hall,  thick,  hesitating, argumentative, and  Janetta's heart stood  still. The  voice  was  Neville's. Every  vestige  of  color  w ent  from   her face. A  visit  from Neville  'at  this hour could  bode  no  good.

'r think  it  is  some  one  asking  for me,'  she  said,  trying  to steady her voice. 'Will  you  excuse  me  for  a   mo­ ment?"

Without  waiting  for  an  answer,  she. went  quickly  into  the  hall;  and  there stood  Nevlll<\  with  a  foolish  sm ile  on h is face,  trying  to  explain  to  Mason t h a t   i t  w as Miss  H ow ard,  n o t  Miss  Sey­ mour,  he  wished  to  speak  to.

'Neville,  come  th is  w ay!'  said  Ja­ n e t t a   sharply,  p u ttin g   a   h an d   on  his a r m   to   steady  his steps,  for  a t  th e   first glance  it was evident  th at  the  boy  had h a d   m ore than enough to   drink.  Mason followed  them  Into  the  study,  where J a n e t t a   took  h e r  'brother,  stirre d   the fire,  and  turned  up  the  gas  w ith  slow deliberation;  and  Jan etta was con­ scious  through  every  fiber  of  her  be­ in g t h a t the  parlor  m aid  knew  her b r o th e r 's   condition  as  w ell  a s   sh e  did, and  she smarted under  the hum iliation and  disgrace.

" T h a t  will  do,  th a n k -y o u .  M ason,' s h e   said ,  closing  the  door  behind  the maid.  "Neville,  what  has  brought you here a t this hour and------'  H er tongue refused  to  finish  the  sentence,

' G ot-the-sack,'  answered  Neville, sulkily,  defiant, 'bringing out each word with,  elaborate  care,  to  prove  th a t  he had  complete  mastery  of  tongue  and brain.

'How can you come  and see me  and tell  m e  th a t?"  said  J a n e tta   w ith  a   sob of  p a in . 'What  am  I  to  do  for  you, when  you  will  do  nothing  for  your self?" ' '   -

against  the  m antel  shelf; while she paced  up  and  down  the  room  in  ex­ trem e  agitation.

'Got  such  a  good  berth  yourself,  I thought----- ' The  thought was too far  back  ln  the  recesses  ot  Neville's muddled  brain  for  him  to  bring  it  to light.

"That  I  could  ask  Miss  Seymour  to take  you  in  as  well  as  myself,'  said Janetta  bitterly. ' You  must  go,  N e­ ville. I  can't  stop  and  talk  to  you  to ­ night. You  are  not fit  to  talk  to.'

'Go  where?'  asked Neville, with dazed  eyes. 'I  thought you'd  never  be the  one  to  turn  me  out!'

'Oh,  what  can  I  do''  cried  Janetta. And  then  came  the  remembrance  of Doctor  Drake's  strong,  kind  face. He would help her if  he knew  in what sore trouble she  was. 'Look here, Neville,*' she  said,  trying  not to  let him  see how she  shrank  from  him. 'I have  one friend  in  this  place,  who  I  believe,  if  I sent  him  a  note  by  you,  will  take  you in  for  the  night. To-morrow I will  see you  and  think  what  can  be  done."

She  was  scribbling  swiftly as she spoke:

''Dear  Doctor  Drake: I  am  in  sore trouble. The  bearer ot this  note  is  my brother-my  only  living  relation-and he  is  as  you  see  him. I  cannot  send him  to  any  lodging  or  hotel  to-night. I  send  him   to  you,  because  you  are  a bachelor,  and  will  understand  what  it is  to  me,  his  sister,  for  him -to  call upon  me  like  this. Will  you  of  your great  goodness  take  him  ln  for  this one  night  and  hide  his  shame,  and  to­ morrow r will  see  him  and  settle  w hat he  m ust  do. Yours  gratefully,

## 'Janetta  Howard.'

She  folded  and  directed  the  letter,

putting it into Neville's nerveless hand. 'This  m an  will  give  j'ou  a  bed  for to-night. I t   is  n o t  fa r  to   go-down  th e hill. When you  get outside  turn to the right,  and  about a  hundred  yards  down the  street  there  is  a  gate  with  a brass plate  on  it. That  is  Doctor  Drake's house.'

Almost  before  he  knew  what his sis­ ter  was  doing,  Janetta  had  led  Neville to  the  door,  reiterating  her  directions in  soft,  low  tones.

She  went  back  to  the  drawing  room, determined  to  tell  Clarice  the  story; but  her  Intention  was  checked  by  the presence  of  Mrs.  Mortimer,  who  stood by Clarice's  sofa,  pouring  out  an  eager torrent of accusation Clarice had raised  herself  to  a  sitting  posture,  and listened  w ith  flushed  cheeks  and  shin­ ing  eyes,  and  with  rather  a  scornful smile.

'I'm glad  you've  come  back,  Janetta. Mrs.  Mortimer  ha.%, been  amusing  me with  really  wonderful  stories,  which she  seems  to  have  gathered  from  b<>r own  and  Mason's  personal  observa­ tion."

'If  the  am using  stories  you  refer  to are  about  myself,  I  shall  be  glad  to hear  them,'  said  Janetta,  standing  be­ fore  Clarice,  w ith  a  burning  red  spot on  either  cheek. She  would  not  even look  a t  her  accuser.

'First item :  A  drunken  lover  Is  sup­ posed  to  have  ju st  come  to  see  you.'

'He  is  not  my  lover. Later  on,  1 shall  be  glad  to  tell  you  who  he  Is; ·but  not  in  the  presence  of  a  third  per­ son.'

"Does  th a t  mean,  Miss  Howard,  that you  wish  to  explain  your  rather  ex­ traordinary conduct  to  Miss  Seymour alone?'  Inquired  Mrs.  Mortimer acidly.

'It  does,'  replied  Janetta,  with  one fearless  glance. 'That  explanation  is necessary  to  her,  but  unnecessary  to you."

'I  think  perhaps  you had better leave  us,"  said  Clarice. As  the  door closed  behind  her,  Clarice  stretched out  her  hands  to  Janetta  with  quick entreaty. 'Oh,  Janetta,  w hat  a   brute you  must  think  me  to  question  any­ thing  you  do! But  she  has  hinted  at such  awful  things! I  only  wait  for your  word  to  declare  everything  un­ true,  and  I  shall  'believe  you."

Leith,  Scotland,  will  become  a  port of  some  capacity  and  trade  two  years hence.  A  suite  ot  docks  is  in  construc­ tion  there,  which  is  to  cost  between 300,000 pounds  and 400,000 pounds more  th a n was  estimated  when the Leith  dock commissioners launched their  program. In  189G  seventy-five acres  ot  the  foreshore  were  reclaimed; and  the  dock  now  near  completion  is 1,900  feet  long,  w ith  a width  of 550 feet for  1,100  feet  of  its  length  and 280  feet  for  the  rem ainder. The  dock walls  are forty-four  feet  high, and there  are  to be  two  pairs  of steel  gates, each  w eighing  close  upon  300  tons.  To this  equipm ent  it  has  been  resolved  to add  a  graving  dock  500  feet  long.
