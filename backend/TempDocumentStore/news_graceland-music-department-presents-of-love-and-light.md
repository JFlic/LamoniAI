Additional songs about love will include an arrangement of “Amazing Grace/My Chains Are Gone” by the Graceland Harmonium, “O Love” by American composer Elaine Hagenberg, and “Seasons of Love” from the popular musical “Rent.”

There will be a brief intermission and then the second half of the concert will focus on the theme of “light.” The second half opens with “Bright Morning Stars” by Swedish composer Anders Paulsson and will feature Ergo on organ, Assistant Professor of Music and Director of Bands Christopher Brandt on soprano saxophone, and seniors Daryn Nowlin and Jordan Bradford as soloists. Harmonium will perform “Northern Lights” by Ola Gjeilo, and then the combined choirs will close with “Dark and Luminous Night,” featuring Presler on violin and Ergo on piano.
