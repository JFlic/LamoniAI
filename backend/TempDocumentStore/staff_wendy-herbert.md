Independence Campus

Physical Therapy Department

Dr. Herbert teaches pharmacology, clinical neuroscience, neuromuscular practice, prosthetics and orthotics, and management of complex patients courses. She is passionate about sharing her 25+ years of knowledge and experience of working with individuals with neurologic conditions, and orthotic and prosthetic needs with future Doctors of Physical Therapy. She hopes to pass on to her students the same feeling of privilege she has had in helping people learn strategies for performing daily tasks to maintain their independence and quality of life.

In her free time, Dr. Herbert enjoys playing the piano, working on crafts, and spending time with her husband and two mini schnauzers.

"The capacity to learn is a gift; the ability to learn is a skill; the willingness to learn is a choice."Brian Herbert
