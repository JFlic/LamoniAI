CHAPTER  V.-(Continued.) 'Were  you  looking for anything. Mason?'

'There!  then  you  heard  me  shut  the draw er!'  said  Mason, with smiling ·sincerity. ' Yes,  miss. Mrs.  M ortimer was  asking  me* for  som e  certain  rings t h a t I'v e mislaid  somewhere,  and  I could  alm ost  have  declared  for  certain t h a t   I   h a d   le f t  them   in   t h a t   rig h th a n d drawer  of  yours  before  you  cam e.'

'There  were  no  rings  there,' said J a n e tta   coldly.

When  Mason  left  th e  room  Janetta opened  the  drawer and peered in. There  w ere  gloves  and  handkerchiefs, which had  evidently  not been touched; but  on  th e   top  ot  all  w ere  N eville's letters,  w hich  Jan etta  k ep t  bound  to­ gether  by  an  elastic  band. One  of them  had  been  taken  from   the  packet, and  w as  half  drawn  from   its  envelope, and  throw n  back  hastily into the drawer.

" I t 's   v e r y   q u eer  an d   u n c o m fo rta b le ,' th o u g h t Janetta. ' I can't conceivc what object  the girl  has  in  w ishing  to read  m y  letters. She  shall  not  have the  privilege! I  don't  w ant  any  one here  to  guess  how  anxious  I  am   about the  boy. I  wish  I  w ere  sure  th a t  he nad  broken  with  all  his  old  friends, no  effort  of mine will keep him straig h t  if  he  won't  try   him self.'

She  slipped  the  le tte r  back  into  the packet,  locked  the  draw er,  and  p ut  the key into her pocket.  H er earthly para­ dise  seemed  failing  her  all in  a m inute. Then  she  remembered  how  often  sho had  found  Mrs.  M ortim er's  eyes  fixed upon  her  when  she  received  one  o£ Neville's  letters  w ith  a   queer,  suspic­ ious  expression  in them ; and she laughed  aloud  as  the  thought  darted th ro u g h   h e r  m ind  th a t  possibly  Mrs. Mortimer  was  crediting  her  w ith  a 'young  m an'  of  her  own, and was ready  to  m ake mischief  about him.

But,  even  if  this  w ere  so,  it  did  not axplaln  the  reason  w hy  Mason  should oe  foraging  about  am ong  her  letters, ^he  finally  decided  to  m ake  no  m en­ tion  of  w h at  had  occurred,  but  to  be rareful  about  keeping  her  possessions under  lock  and  key  for  the  future.

## CHAPTER  VI.

Clarice  w as  not  a t  all  well  for  tho next  few  days,  so  th a t  it was not aifficult  fo r  Ja n e tta   to   avoid  an y   in­ tim ate  conversation  w ith  C aptain  Me:1i /a le .

Her  laten t  suspicion  of  Mason  was tanned  into  a  flame  by  the  fact  th.it one  afternoon,  when  she  ran  in  late from  th e   tow n,  having  gone  on  soruf. commission  for Clarice, she h-=ai(i Poices  talk in g   in  the  shrubbery  near. One  of  th e  voices  w as  a  m an's,  tho other  M ason's.

' I  s h a 'n 't   do it, I  te ll  you! There are plenty  of  people  In  th e  house  who'd find  me  out,  and  th a t  new  one  is  as sharp  as  a  needle1'

J a n e tt a   h u rrie d   on  h e r  way,  feeling very  uneasy. What  was  it  th a t  Mason Was  declining  to  do,  and to whom ::ould  she  be  talking? That  the  'new one'  referred  to  her  she  was  tolerably certain. Perhaps  it  would  be  wise  to mention  the circumstances to Mrs. Mortimer. Accordingly  th at  evening, when  Clarice  had  gone  to  bed.  she returned  to  the  draw ing  room  and  re­ lated  to  Mrs.  M ortimer  w hat  ihe  had overheard.

'It  seem s  to  me.  M iss  H ow ard,  th at you  are  m aking  m ountains out of molehills,'  said  Mrs.  M ortim er  calmly. "Mason  is  an  excellent  servant,  most civil  and  obliging, her  character  U beyond  suspicion '

"I  could  swear  to  her  voice;'  said Janetta,  a  little  hotly. "Has  the  a .young  m an,  do  you  know ?'

'Oh,  yes. Is  th e re a  law ot tlio Medes  and  Persians  th a t  parlor  rialds should  be  exempt  from   love-aflnirs?' asked  Mrs.  Mortimer. 'She's  engaged to  a   v e ry   respectable  fellow   w bo  does not  live  here. Indeed,  I  ha?-;?'Hi  to know  th a t  he's  not  in  the  jtlvije  at present,  for  she  only  asked  n v   leave today  for  a  few  days  holiday  to  go and visit his  people. She f.c-ld  mo t h a t she  had  not  seen  him  for  more than  six  m onths. I  really   th in k ,  Miss Howard,  th a t  It  will  be  wiser  K  you leave  the  m anagem ent  of  tho  house and  servants  to  me.'

"Certainly  I  will  in  future,'  rc/)lied. Janetta, swallowing her vexation;  'but it  is  th e   second  tim e  th a t  I  have  had suspicions  about  M ason's  straightfor­ wardness.'

'A letter for you,  m iss,'  said  a  voice behind  her,  and  Mason,  w ith  a  per­ fectly  Immovable  face,  handed  her  a letter  on  a  silver  w aiter. I t   w as  from Neville,  and  Janetta  slipped  it  into  her pocket;  and  she'  felt  somehow  as  if tier  actions  were  noted  alike by  both Mason  and  Mrs.  M ortimer.

'Straightforw ardness,  indeed!'  m ut­ tered  Mrs.  M ortimer angrily, when J a n e tta   b a d e   h er  g o o d -n ig h t  a n d   w en t off  to  h e r room. ' S he's none too straightforw ard  herself, with letters from  one  m an  nearly  every  day  of  her life, and  playing  fast-and-loose  with Miss  Seymour's  lover  under  her  very eyes,  only  she's to o   in fatu ated   to  see it.' I t   w ill  be  seen  th a t  Mrs.  M orti­ mer was letting her  jealousy  run  away with  h e r  judgm ent.

T h a t  le tte r  made  J ' : t t a   v e r y   a n x ­ ious  and  miserable. I t   w as  a n   u rg en t iemand  for  money.

"I  lite ra lly   haven't  a   copper  to  bless myself  w ith,' wrote Neville. ''The landlady's  using  aw ful  language,  and 'f  yon  can't  help  m e  I  believe  soon (he'll  tu r n   m e  out  in to   th e  stree t.

For  once  in  her  life  th e  softening veil  of  alm ost  m otherly  love  and  affec­ tion  th a t  J a n e tta   had  for  h e r  b ro th er was  to rn   aside,  and  she  saw   him   as  he ' ' a s -w eak,  selfish,  unscrupulous. She knew  th a t  she  had left him wkh enough  money  to  keep  him  in  comfort; for  tw o  m onths  at  least,  and  the  5rst was  not  yet  over.

All through  the night she  lay tossing and  wretched,  wondering  w hat  to  do for  the  best. In  the  wide  world  she had  not  a  single  friend  of  whom  she could  ask  advice. Fifty  pounds  was all  th a t  w as  left  of  the  w reck  ot  th eir little  fortune,  and  she  dare  not  draw it  out.

Supposing  th a t  by any unforeseen circumstance  she  was  throw n  out  of her  present  situation,  she  m ust  havo some  sm all  reserve  fund,  so  th a t  she could  support  herself  u ntil  she  coul.l obtain  som ething  else.

Clarice  would  have  been  the  first  to notice  her  heavy  eyes  the following morning,  but th a t her h eart was full of her  own  troubles.

'He's  going  tomorrow,  Jan etta,'  she said,  when  the  girl  entered  her  room. 'I  can't  th in k   w hat  is  th e  m a tte r  w ith me. I never  cry  at  the  thought  ot his  going;  but  today  I  could  sob  my heart  out. I 've  a  w eight  like  lead  oa it. I  feel  som ething  as  if  I  had  come to  an  end  of  it  ail.'

'An  end  ot  what?'  questioned  Jan ­ etta  kindly.

'Of  life-or,  rather, of the love which  is  my  life. He's  going  right away  from  me,  and  he  m ay  be  going to  his  d e a th !'

'You can  tru st  him  to  God's  hands,' said  Ja n e tta   gently.

'Oh  he  may  forget  me.'

' You  tru s t  him   too  w ell  to  th in k   of th a t.'

'I  shall  feel  th a t  he  h as  passed  be­ yond  my  reach;  there is  something which  seems  to  warn  me  th at  I  am losing  him   forever.'

When  Clarice  was  dressed  and  car­ ried  to  her  boudoir,  H arry Mcrivale came and  sat duwn by her, and Janetta watched  the  restless  look  die  out  of Clarice's  face,  all  doubt  and  discontent dispelled  by  the  sunshine  of her  lover's presence. Then  she slipped quietly from  the  room,  and  went  to  the  study to  answ er  her  brother's  letter.

She  did  not  begin  it  a t  once,  her heart  was  full  of  her  friend,  and  hev miocry  n.t  lior  Inver's  d e m rtu rp -  ami yet,  w as  she  so  greatly  to  be  pitied? She  thought  of  the  adoration  she  had seen  w ritten  but  now  upon  her  fea­ tures,  of  th e  tender,  loving  sym pathy of  his.

To  love  and  be  loved,  after  all,  were the  two  chief  factors  of  hum an  happi­ ness,  and  th a t  Clarice  had. One  diffi­ culty Captain Merivale's departure would remove  from her path-sho would  not  need  to  make  excuse.*  to avoid  going  out  with  him . Their  ac­ quaintance wouft.1  be  brought  to  an  ab­ rupt  term ination.

Then  she  opened  and  re-read he/ brother's  letter,  and'  tho  oftener  she read  it  th e   m ore  perplexed  she  became as  to  w h at  the  answer  should  be. De­ spite  her  love and  w arning,  Neville  was steering  straight  for the rock on which  their  father  had  wrecked  his life! Janetta laid  down  her  head  upon her  arm s  and  sobbed  aloud.

'Miss Howard,  Clarice wants  to 'know------'  Captain  Merivale  stood in dismayed  astonishment behind J a n ­ e t t a 's chair,  the  question  he  came  to ask  dying  on  his  lips. This  man,  who would .have  faced  an arm y without tu rn in g  color, was  inclined  to run  away a t   th e   s ig h t  of  a  w om an's  tears.

'I'm  sorry-I'm  afraid  I've  intruded upon  you,'  he  stammered.

"Yes-no-at  least,  it  doesn't mat­ te r,' said  Janetta. 'I'm  in  trouble, but  no  one  can  help  me  out  of  it. What  did  Miss  Seymour  w ish?'

'Forgive  me,'  said  H arry gently; 'but  in  your  great  kindness  the  other day  you  assigned  to  me  th e  position of  friend. If  you  feel  me  to  be  such, can't  I  help  you? If  you  are  alone  in the  world,  as  Clarice  hinted  to  me  one day,  it  is  possible  th a t  ju s t  a   common, everyday  fellow  like  m yself  may  be  of use  to  you,  m ight  give  you  advice,  for example,  on  any  business  m atter  that is  b o th e rin g   you.'

There  was  a  dawning  hope  in  Jan­ e t t a 's  h e a r t  th a t  here  w as  th e  friend she  needed;  this  kind, capable, cul­ tured  m an  of  the  world  would  be  able to  tell  h e r  w hat  was  th e   really  wise thing to -do  about Neville.

'I have  one  brother,  and  I'm  lh trouble  about  him,'  she  said  simply.

'Yes,'  said  Harry,  seating  himself in  a  chair  w ith  grave  atten tio n . Then bit  by  b it  Ja n e tta   told  him   the  story, ju st  the  sim ple  facts; and  Harry,  as he  listened,  saw  how  the  girl's  life had  been  one  long  self-sacrifice,  and offering  for  the  Salvation  of  another, who  apparently  declined  to  be  saved. His  heart  burned  with  Indignation.

'And you  wish  to  know  if  it is  right to  th ro w   good  money  a fte r  bad,  to  rob yourself  of  your  last  farth in g   so  th a t your  brother  may  be  saved  for  a  week or  two  longer  from  th e  consequences of  his  own  wilfulness?'  he  said,  when Janetta  paused  for  a  m om ent.

'I t   does  n o t  seem  to  m e  a   difficult question  to  decide. If  you  w ant  to complete  th a t  young  fellow 's  ruin,  you will  go  on  letting  him  depend  upon you  as  h e   has  done  hitherto.:  You  tell me  th a t  he  cannot  live  on  his  salary, and  th a t, you  have  taken  th is  situation

in  order  to  supplement  It, SSlni,  I think  it  Is  a  wholly  wronj;  principle for  a  b ro th e r  to  take  help  from   a   lis ­ ter;  but,  still,  you  have  promised  to help  him. Very  well,  stick  to  th e   ex­ act  letter  of  your  promise,  and  don't go  a  farth in g   beyond  it.

'I'm  passing  through  town  tom or­ row,  and  will  go  and  see  him  if  you like. I t might  not  hurt  him  to  hear the  opinion  of  a  man  about  his  be­ havior.

'Oh,  n o !''  cried  Jan etta  quickly. 'I could  not  bear  to  think  that  I  had  ever discussed  him   with  anybody. It  is  the first  tim e  in  my  life  that  I  have  done it,  and  I'm   only, driven  to  it  now  bocause  I  am   a t  my  w its'  end.'

"Well,  then,  write him a short, wholesome  refusal. You  can't  think what  good  it  does. It  brings  a  young fellow  to  his  bearings,"  sai.l  the  Cap­ tain,  w ith  a  smile,  remembering  such a  refusal  him self

Janetta  rose. 'I  can't  thank  you enough. I  m ust  have  been  fanciful  11 ? other  day,  but  I  was  silly  eno igti  tJ think  th a t  you  wore  v?xed  wit!;  in when  I  said  I  hoped  always  to  keep you  and  Miss  Sejm our  as  friends  '

Harry  looked  down  at  the  beautiful wistful  face  with  an  odd  tw nchius  ot his  own.

"You  drive'rce  hard,'  he said.  ' Shall I ttll you  something,  that  you,  and you  alone,  are  the  cause  of  my  sudden departure  to-morrow,  that  there  are moments  in  the  life  of  a  man  when  all he  can  do  is  to  run  away?

"Miss  Ho waul,  I  did  not  know  upon what  rock  I  was  tlriftirg  until  th a t  ap­ peal  of  yours  to  my  friendship, and then,  like  a  flash  of  lightning,  the  true state  of  things  was  revealed  lo  me. Friendship with you' Impossible! Friendship  could  not  satisfy  mol  Had I been  free----- "

Janetta  heard  him  thus far with eyes  th a t  grew  larger  every  m om ent with  te rro r  and  despair.

'No,  n o " '  she  cried;  'please  stop! You  m ust  not  say  it,  and  I  m ust  not listen. Forget  that  you  have  ever  said or  thought  it. A h ''  she  cried,  w ring­ ing  her  hands,  "w hat  have  I  done  but betray  my  best,  my  kindest  friend?"

He  could  have  taken  her  hands,  but she  snatched  them  lrom  him  aiul  flew from  the  room. Just  outside  tho  door she  cannoned  against  Mrs.  Mortimer, who  glanced  at  the  girl's  red  eyes and  disbe'^lled  hair  with  cynical  con­ tempt.

"Is  C aptain  Merivale  in  the  siudy?" she  asked. 'Miss  Seymour  w ants  to speak  to  him   before  lie  goes  out "

Janetta  did  not  stop  to  answer,  but ran  upstairs  to  her  room;  and  Mrs. Mortimer  heard  the  lcey-turn  in the lock.

A  very  agony  of shame  shook  Janet­ ta's  w hole  frame,  aud  she  threw   her­ self  sobbing  on  her  knees. A  m ist  of falsehood  and  wrongdoing  seemed  en­ veloping  her  like  a  cloak,  and  for  the first  tim e  in   her  life  she  found  it  ditfieult  to   discern  rig h t  from  wrong.

Hor  lioart  mas  llPV  WitllPSS  tllat  sllO had  intended  to  do  no  hurt  to  the friend  to  whom she  was bound  by  every tie  of  g ra titu d e   and  affection,  and  yet Captain  Merivale's  unfinished  sentence had  awakened  an  answering  echo  in her  heart,  had  roused  her  to  the  awful knowledge  that  she,  on  her  side,  loved him  w ith an intensity  as great  a? Clarice's  own.

'T  can  redeem  the  past. I  am  sure t it's  n o t too  late  for  th a t'"   she said. |  s p r in g in g to her feet in fever:  lsh  m isery.

## Teacher  Abandoned  Reform.

## DEERING  AT  PARIS IN 1900,

rho  Famous  Chicago Harvester  Com* pa ay Kccolved More nnd Greater llo u o n than Were Ever lie f ore Accorded  an  American Exhibitor  iv the  History  of  Expositions.

America  may  well  feel  proud  of  the interest  which  her  citizens  took  in  the Paris  Exposition  and  the  elaborate  ex­ hibits  which  were  prepared  w ith  con­ summate skill  and  displayed  in  a m an­ ner  not  excelled  by  any  other  country. Those of Harvesting Machinery  In  par­ ticular  were  most  complete  and  in ter­ esting. The  Deering  H arvester  Com­ pany,  of  Chicago,  America's  forem ost manufacturer of this line  of goods,  was accorded  the  position  of  honor,  having contributed  more  to  tho  advancement of the art of  harvesting than any  other manufacturer,  living  or  dead,  and  with a  greater  array  of  im portant  inven­ tions  to  its  credit  than  any  o th e r  com­ pany  in  tho  world.

Visitors  to  the Exposition wers prompt  to  accord  tlie  Deering  exhibits supreme  honors,  and  it  only  rem ained for  official  m andate  to  ratify  the  popu­ la r erdict,  which  was  done  in  a   m an­ ner as substantial  as  it was w ell-m erit­ ed. Each one of  the  seven  D eering  ex­ hibits  secured  tho  highest  aw ard  in its  class.

In  addition  to  four  high decora­ tions,  the  Deering  H arvester  Com panj receh ed  twenty-five  awards,  or  tw en­ ty-nine  in  all,  as  follows Decoratiou of  Officer  of  the  Legion  of  H onor,  Dec­ oration  of  Chevalier  of  tho  Legion  of Honor,  Two  Decorations  of  Officer  01 Merito  Agricolc.  a  Special  C o rtiflc a t« of  Honor,  The  Grand  Prize,  Six  Gold Medals,  Six  Silver  Medals  and  Eleven Bronze  Medals,  including  Deering  Col laborator  Medals.

Tho  Decoration  of  the Legion ot Honor  was  Instituted by Napoleon Bonaparte  when  First  Consul  in  1802, and  is  only  conferred  in  recognition of distinguished military or civil aiiiiufem ents. I t is  tliu  nigliesl  dis­ tinction  in  the  gift  of  the  F ren ch   Re­ public.

The  Decoration  of  tho  M erlte  Agricole  is  an honor of  but slightly less  im­ portance,  which is conferred  upon those  who  have  contributed  greatly  to the  advancement  ot  agriculture.

An  Official  Certificate  of  H onor  was accorded  the  Deering Retrospective Exhibit,  which  showed  the  im prove­ ments  in  harvesting  m achinery  during the  past century,  and  excited  th e  high­ est  praise  of  the  French  Government Officials  who  had  entrusted to the Deering  Harvester  Company  the  prep­ aration  of  this  most  im portant  exhibit. By  special  request  this exhibit has been  presented  to  tho  N ational  Mu­ seum  of  Arts  and  Sciences  a t  P art: where  it  has  become  a  perm anent  fea­ ture  of  that  world-famed  Institution.

11. But  Mary  was  standing  without  at tho  sepulcher  weeping,  and  as  sho  wept, she  stooped  down,  and  looked  into  the sepulcher.

12. And  she  beholdeth  two  angels  in white  sitting,  the  one  at  the  head,  and tho  other  at  tho  feet,  where  tho  body  ot Jesus  had  lain.

33 . And  they  soy  unto  her,  Woman, why  weepest  thou 7 She  saith  unto  them, Because  they  have  taken  away  my  Lord, and  I  know  not  where  they  have  laid him.

14. And  when  sho  had  thus  said,  she turned  herself  back,  and  beholdeth  Jesus standing,  aud  knew  not  that  it  was  Je­ sus.

15. Jesus  saith  unto  her,  Woman,  why weepest  thou?  Whom  seekest  thou?  She, supposing  him  to  be  the  gardener,  saith unto  him.  Sir,  it  thou  have  borno  him hence,  tell  mo  where  thou  hast  laid  him, and  I  will  take  him  away.

16 . Jesus  saith  unto  her,  Mary Sho turned  hersolf,  and  saith  unto  him  in Hebrew,  Rabboni,  which  is  to  say,  Mas­ ter.

17. Jesus  saith  unto  her,  Touch  me not; for  I am  not  yet  ascended  unto  the Father;  but  go  unto  my  brethren,  and say  unto  them,  I  ascend  unto  my  1' atlier and  your  Father,  and  my  God  and  your God.

IS. Mary  Magdalene  cometh  and  telieth tho  disciples. I  have  seen  tho  Lord,  and how  that  ho  had  spoken  these  things  un­ to her.

Points  of  Lesson  to  Commit.-Recapitu­ lation.  1.  Jesus  rose  from  the  dead  early Sunday  morning,  April  0,  A.  D.  30.

2. A  company  of  women,  with  spices, come  to  the  tomb  from  various  parts  of tho  city,  and,  doubtless,  not  all  together 3. They  llnd  tho  stone  rolled  away  and the  tomb  cmpty

- 4. Mary  Magdalene,  one  ot  the  com­ pany.  Immediately  hastes  away,  and  tells Peter  flrst  and  then  John  (as  Is  suggest­ ed  by  the  repetition  ot  the  preposition  in John  20.2).
- 5. Tho  other  women  in  the  tomb  see two  bright  angels,  who  tell  them  that Jesus  has  ly/5jn,  and  will  meet  his  dis­ ciples  in  Galilee.

6 They,  trembling  and  astonished  with mlnslid  fear  and  joy,  lice  from  the  tomb, and'tun  to  the  city  to  tell  tho  apostles, who.  apparently,  were  in  different  parts of  the  city

7 Peter  and  John,  having  heard  the news  from  Mary  Magdalene,  run  swiftly to  ihe  tomb,  and  llnd  It  empty,  as  re­ ported They  return  home,  Peter  won­ dering.  and  John  believing.

Mary  Magdalene  is  to  be  distinguished from  the  "woman  who  was  o.  ainnci. who  anointed  the  feet  of  Jesus  In  tho Pharisee's  house  (Luke  7.30-50),  and  from Mary,  the  sister  ot  ..tartha Magdalene '·doubtless  Indicates  that  sho  was  a  resi­ dent  of  Magdala,  on  tho  southwestern coast  of  the  Sea  of  Galilee. There  Is  rea­ son  to  suppose  that  Mary  was  In  less humble  circumstances  than  most  of ouf Lord's  disciples."

Sho  had,  when  she  first  knew  Jesus,  a most  terrible  nfllictton She  was  a  de­ moniac,  with  all  its  horrible  and  painful accompaniments. Just  what  the  disease wcv.l  (YU  tlO 1 IUL  lino-n1,  ljUt  it  yrfxo  alticd to  some  of  our  worst  forms  of  Insanity, and  the  descriptions  given  of  demoniacs, in  tho  New  Testament,  present  a  very sad picture. One  such,  a  boy,  is  described as  often  falling  Into  the  tire  and  often Into the  water  (Rlatt. 17  15, IS). The spirit  makes him  dumb,  'nnd  wheresoever ho  taketh  him  he  teareth  him,  and  he foametli,  and  gnashetli  with  his  teeth, and plneth  away'  (Mark 0 17, IS) The  Gadarene  demoniac  was  wild  and  flcrce,  cry­ ing  and  cuttlr<? himself  with  slones.' That  her  case  ■'*as  unusually  severo  Is shown  from  tho  -'■act  that  sho  was  pos­ sessed  of  seven  Ciomons  (Luke  8 2),  like the  Gadareno  who  t~ns  possessed  by  a.  le­ gion,  and  the  man  In  the  parable,  who was  like  a  houso  swept  nnd  garnished after  one  demon  had  been  cast  out,  but which  returned  with  seven  companions worse  than  himself  (Matt.  12.43-15)

Jesus  had  cured  Mary  Magdalene  (Luko 8:2). and  henceforth  she  \Vtis  his  most devoted  follower,  "and  tho  greatness  of the  deliveralico  redounded  to  tjip  glQri' of  the  deliverer ' Sho  \v3a  In  liuf  right mind,  and  was  among  those  ministering women  who  devoted  much  of  their  prop­ erty  and  their  time  to  tho  service  ot  their Master,  Including  "Joanna,the  court  lady, and  Salome,  the  fisherman's  wife." Sho is  with  them  around  tlie  cross,  "drawn  by a fearful fascination to tho appalling spectacle,  anti  joins  with  tho  others  In preparing  tho  spices,  and  hastens  among the  earliest  lo  the  tomb.

Practical. 1 What  a change  Jesus wrought  In  this  woman;  from  a  disor­ dered  brain  to  a  right  and  noly  mliul; from  the  possession  of  devils  to  the  abid­ ing  presence  of  Christ  and  the  Indwelling of  the  Holy  Spirit

2. Jesus  still  works  such  changes  In the  souls  of  men. The  wondrous  changes of  his  grace  can  be  seen  by  those  who look, for  multitudes  are  thus  changed every  year There  is  hope  for  the  worst. There  arc  those  who  have  been  drunk­ ards,  and  dishonest,  and  selfish,  who  aro changed  till  they  shine  "with  the  bright­ ness  of  the  firmament  and  as  the  stars forever  and  ever,'  becauso  they  have  not only  turned  themselves  but  many  others to righteousness.

Illustrations.-Ruins  like  those  of  Baby­ lon, where  "wild  beasts  of  the  deserts lie,'  "and  satyrs  dance,'  and  which  are "full  of  doleful  creatures,'  changed  to  a beautiful  "city  of  the  Lord,'  "the  Zion of  the  Holy  One  of  Israel."

A  house  full  of  carousals  and  crimes, 111 ventilated,  unclean,  with  broken  and defiled  windows,  changed  to  a  beautiful homo,  pure,  healthful,  tilled  with  love  and PMCS.

Illustration.-Here  Is  a  lump  of  black coal  which  the  miner  brings  up  from  the depths  ot  the  earth. He  tells  you  to take  It  Into  your  house  and  it  will  1111 your  apartment  with light, but you shrink  from  touching  it,  and  say,  "Sure­ ly,  there  is  no  light  In  that? See1  It  only blackens  my  fingers. It can  shed  no beams  of  light  In  my  room ' Yet  that lump  of  coal  is  Indeed  a  seed  of  light.  The man of  science  takes  it  and  puts  it  in his  retort,  and  your  chamber  is  made bright  as  day  by  its  unlmprisoned  beams.

## An, fckmuol  Oi  I)ycr  Tolls  a  Harrowing Tnle  of  Suffering*

M'Carron,  Mich ,  April  S.-(Special.) -Mrs.  Samuel  G.  Dyer  ot  this  place has given  the  following interesting let­ ter  for  publication;

"For years  I  suffered  intense  pain  la the  region  oi  tho  heart, I doctored with the best physicians. Some of them would  relievo  me  for  a  short  time,  but tho  pain  always  r?tur&ed. My  heart. '>vas  so  bad  th a t I  would  have to  sit  ttj, In  bed  for hours,  to  get  relief. I  would lie awake  almost  all  night. I  am  02years  of  age,  and  no  one  can  under­ stand  how  much  I  suffered  with  this1 Heart  Trouble.

"About a  year ago  I  heard  of Dodd's1 Kidney  Pills,  and  commenced  to  usa them. From  tho  first  my  condition1 Improved,  The  pain  in  my  heart grad­ ually  grew  less,  and  my  general  health! much  better,  and  now  I  can  say  posi­ tively  th a t  I  am  entirely  cured. I  can^ sleep  all  night,  and  enjoy  alm ost  per-j tect  health. I  thank  God  for  tho  cure, that  has  come  to  me  through  tho  use of  Dodd's  Kidney  Pills.

'I  have thought long over  the m atter' of  giving  thi*  letter  for  publication,! and  am  doing  so now  w ithout  any  so-' licitation whatever, and  simply  be­ cause I  feel  It to be  my  duty  to  express the  profound  gratitude  I  feel  for  my recovery,  and  to let  others who  may be suffering  as  I  was  know  how  they may llnd  a  cure. I  know  that  nothing  else' but  Dodd's  Kidney  Pills  cured  me,  be­ cause  I  have  taken  no  other  medicine for  over  a  year. I  feel  better  now than  I  have  for  many  years,  and  it  ia all  due  to  the  use  of  Dodd's  Kidney Pills.'

Mrs.  Dyer's  case  and  its  cure  has  at­ tracted  a  great  deal  of  attention,  and her  letter  Is  a  splendid  tribute  to  tho curative  properties  of  Dodd's  Kidney Pills.
