# Science – Teacher Certification in Basic Science

STUDENTS WHO WANT A SECONDARY SCIENCE ENDORSEMENT (5-12) IN BASIC SCIENCE and desire Iowa Teacher Certification with a Basic Science secondary endorsement must complete 35 s.h. in science to include:

A study of the diversity of life (prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants, and animals), focusing on the key characteristics of life, the evolutionary processes that shape life, and the ecological interactions among organisms and their physical environments.  Includes a lab.  Additional fee required.

A comparative study of form and function across organisms, focusing on the various structures and strategies used by plants and animals to fulfill basic life needs, levels of organization (cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems), and the chemical reactions of metabolism.  Includes a lab. Additional fee required.

A study of the various patterns and mechanisms of heredity, changes in the genetic material and the consequences of these genetic changes. The course will also give an introduction to cellular structures, macromolecules, and processes, including DNA replication, transcription, translation and cellular signaling. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: CHEM1330, CHEM3410, or (CHEM1410 and CHEM1450). (C or better strongly recommended).

General Chemistry I Workshop is appropriate for any student interested in developing a strong background in chemistry. It is intended to be the first university chemistry course for science majors. As such, it will be fairly rigorous and will draw upon previous experience in mathematics and science. Major areas to be covered include atomic and molecular structures, chemical bonding, stoichiometric relationships, and chemical reactions. Laboratory activities and experiments are closely related to concepts introduced in class discussions and will allow students to develop their laboratory skills. Good safety practices and experimental record keeping will be stressed. Students are expected to actively participate in class activities and discussions in addition to homework assignments, individual/group study and preparation for exams. Course is intended for biology, chemistry, and some allied health majors.  Additional fee required. Fulfills liberal learning science course. Prerequisites: MATH1280 and CHEM1310 or one year of high school chemistry.  EL06 Science, GE3D Liberal Learning-Natural Sciences.

General Chemistry II Workshop is appropriate for any student interested in developing a strong background in chemistry. It is the continuation of CHEM1430. Students will gain a deeper understanding of basic chemical principles and will emphasize problem solving. It is fairly rigorous and will draw upon previous chemistry experience as well as mathematics and other science fields. Major areas to be covered include physical properties of solids, liquids, and solutions, intermolecular forces, energy changes in chemical reactions, thermodynamics, gas-phase equilibrium, and aqueous acid/base equilibrium. Laboratory activities and experiments are closely related to concepts introduced in class discussions and will allow students to develop their laboratory skills. Good safety practices and experimental record keeping will be stressed. Students are expected to actively participate in class activities and discussions in addition to homework assignments, individual/group study and preparation for exams. Prerequisite: CHEM1410.

A study of the objectives, methods, techniques, materials, and activities related to teaching science and mathematics in the secondary schools. Prerequisite: 20 hours in science or mathematics and Prerequisites:  admittance into Teacher Education, unless part of an approved Liberal Studies Program.

An elementary physics course emphasizing the fundamental concepts associated with the physical universe. Topics include Newtonian mechanics, fluids, heat thermodynamics, wave motion, and sound. Designed to meet the needs of biology majors and students preparing for the medical profession and related fields. Prerequisites: Two years high school algebra and one year geometry; plane trigonometry recommended.

A continuation of PHYS1410. Topics included are electricity, magnetism, electromagnetic waves, light, relativity, quantum mechanics, and nuclear physics. Prerequisite: PHYS1410.

- CHEM1410General Chemistry I Workshop with LabCHEM1410General Chemistry I Workshop with Lab  - 4 s.h.General Chemistry I Workshop is appropriate for any student interested in developing a strong background in chemistry. It is intended to be the first university chemistry course for science majors. As such, it will be fairly rigorous and will draw upon previous experience in mathematics and science. Major areas to be covered include atomic and molecular structures, chemical bonding, stoichiometric relationships, and chemical reactions. Laboratory activities and experiments are closely related to concepts introduced in class discussions and will allow students to develop their laboratory skills. Good safety practices and experimental record keeping will be stressed. Students are expected to actively participate in class activities and discussions in addition to homework assignments, individual/group study and preparation for exams. Course is intended for biology, chemistry, and some allied health majors.  Additional fee required. Fulfills liberal learning science course. Prerequisites: MATH1280 and CHEM1310 or one year of high school chemistry.  EL06 Science, GE3D Liberal Learning-Natural Sciences.
- CHEM1420General Chemistry II Workshop with LabCHEM1420General Chemistry II Workshop with Lab  - 4 s.h.General Chemistry II Workshop is appropriate for any student interested in developing a strong background in chemistry. It is the continuation of CHEM1430. Students will gain a deeper understanding of basic chemical principles and will emphasize problem solving. It is fairly rigorous and will draw upon previous chemistry experience as well as mathematics and other science fields. Major areas to be covered include physical properties of solids, liquids, and solutions, intermolecular forces, energy changes in chemical reactions, thermodynamics, gas-phase equilibrium, and aqueous acid/base equilibrium. Laboratory activities and experiments are closely related to concepts introduced in class discussions and will allow students to develop their laboratory skills. Good safety practices and experimental record keeping will be stressed. Students are expected to actively participate in class activities and discussions in addition to homework assignments, individual/group study and preparation for exams. Prerequisite: CHEM1410.
