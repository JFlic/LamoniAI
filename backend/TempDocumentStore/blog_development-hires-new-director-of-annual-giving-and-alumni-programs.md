Graceland University development welcomed a new member to the team, Colby Connely ’13, who will serve as the director of annual giving and alumni programs. He previously worked as the assistant director at Fort Lewis College, where he hired, supervised, evaluated, and trained housing staff, including eight professional Residence Directors, a faculty-in-residence, and indirectly, up to 40 student staff members.

Connely was raised in Pennsylvania as a part of the Community of Christ. Like several family members before him, he attended Graceland where he earned his degree in Psychology and English. While in Lamoni, he participated in house council and served as House President of Cheville. After graduation, he worked as a residence hall director, where he developed his passion for higher education.

When asked about why he chose to return to Graceland, Connely said, “I had a great experience attending and working at Graceland and I always said if there was an opportunity to return, I would love to come back. This community has meant so much to me, I want to help others continue their journey as they move through Graceland and beyond.”

As the director of annual giving and alumni programs, Connely will work with the advancement team to support students by growing the Graceland Fund and collaborating with alumni to create opportunities for networking and connecting.

“Colby is an inspiring community builder whose love of Graceland will bring an extra level of enthusiasm and passion to the role,” saidKristi Hettrick, Vice President for Institutional Advancement.
