Graceland University Gleazer School of Education Licensure Reciprocity document

The research completed for the Iowa IHE Licensure Reciprocity was completed by colleagues from all Iowa Higher Education Institutions with Educator Preparation Programs. The research was then verified by another colleague from a different institution to serve as a third-party reviewer. Reviews will occur annually in conjunction with the Iowa Association of Colleges of Teacher Education (IACTE) conference each fall after the previous year’s legislative session has closed.
