Step into your spotlight at Graceland.

From our impressive facilities to our small class sizes, it’s easy to see why students love the fine arts at Graceland University. Within our Visual and Performing Arts program there are three departments, art, music and theatre, to choose from. In addition to our many courses, each of these departments have specialties in exciting creative endeavors any Graceland student can participate. Take a sculpture or 3D design class, join our band, orchestra or choir or even try out for one of our major theatre productions that are put on each year.

Graceland is home to some of the finest art, music and theatre facilities in the Midwest.

Shaw Centerfeatures the state-of-the-art JR Theatre, a black box theatre equipped with lighting, sound and multi-functional qualities equal to the best such theaters in the country; the acoustically-perfect, 150-seat Carol Hall recital hall; the 500-seat Shaw Family Auditorium; and a beautiful outdoor amphitheatre.

The Helene Center for the Visual Artsis open 24 hours a day so students can create at any time day or night. The facility features two professional gallery exhibition spaces, a graphic design computer lab, a north-facing panting and drawing rooms, as well as dedicated sculpture and ceramic studios.
