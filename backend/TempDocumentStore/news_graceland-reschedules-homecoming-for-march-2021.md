June 25, 2020

Graceland University announced to its alumni Wednesday that it will postpone this year’s homecoming activities until March 19-21, 2021.

Homecoming is a multigenerational experience that brings together students with Graceland’s highly engaged alumni base, who return to the Lamoni, Iowa, campus for activities like the annual homecoming football game, Graceland’s iconic air band competition, honor class dinners, alumni awards and more.

The decision to postpone homecoming was made to ensure the health of the Graceland community, as well as that of Graceland alumni and friends.

Graceland is aware this is likely very disappointing to Gracelanders who regularly plan to attend during the gorgeous Iowa October weekends, and this decision likely raises several questions.

What about commencement for the Spring Class of 2020?

Graceland will still hold its rescheduled commencement ceremony for recent graduates Saturday, Oct. 3. The logistics have not yet been determined, but social distancing guidelines and other CDC guidance will be followed in all gatherings. More details to come.

When is the dedication for Newcom Student Union?

Graceland plans to have a formal dedication of the building Saturday, Oct. 3. Once the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the university will be glad to welcome all back to campus with open arms. Newcom Student Union will transform the student life experience, and the university looks forward to showcasing this beautiful new building.

What about air band?

Part of the air band experience is having everyone, alumni and students alike, together. Graceland is looking at ways to still hold air band, possibly in the spring during the newly scheduled homecoming date. Stay tuned for more.

Wasn’t this year the 125th anniversary of Graceland?

Indeed. It still is! Graceland wants as many people as possible to be a part of any 125th anniversary festivities, so this celebration will be postponed until March as well.

This decision is consistent with Graceland’s“Toward Together”reopening plan, announced Monday. By limiting the number of outside visitors to campus, the university believes it will be able to keep students, employees and the greater Lamoni community safer and healthier.

Any questions regarding homecoming should be directed to the alumni programs office atalumni@graceland.edu.
