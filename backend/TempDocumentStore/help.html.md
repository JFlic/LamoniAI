# Brief User Instructions

First enter your search text and identify whether you are searching within
   the (1) INSCRIPTION, (2) the purchaser's NAME,
   or (3) the BRICK ID. You can change the sort order or click the
   boxes for a different look, but you must 
   press SEARCH each time to see the effect of any change.

Searches are case insensitive (jones,Jones, 
   orJONESare the same). Unless you are using wildcards
   (see Advanced Searching below) you are looking for an exact match.
   Thus,John J Doedoes not findJohn J. Doe.

It is easier to find what you are looking for by using part of a name,
   likeKathto findKathryn,KathyandKathleen-- ormemoto 
   findmemorialandmemory.

The asterisk (*) is a wildcard that matches any string. It even spans
   multiple lines if you are searching brick inscriptions. To increase the
   chance of finding what you want place it between words. For instance, 
   seaching forBill*Loisfinds cases whereBillprecedesLoiseven if there are other letters, symbols, or
   inscription lines between them. Be sure to do another search forLois*Billto find instances whereLoiscomes first.

The Brick ID identifies its location. L-T2-012 is the ID
   for brick 12 in section T2 on the Lamoni campus. To find all inscribed
   bricks in this same section useL-T2-. To find all #12
   bricks in any of Lamoni's brick plaza sections useL-*-012.

For a general view of the Lamoni or Independence campus brick plaza site,
   press the respective map site button.
   Next click on a section and then a brick to see a photo if one exists.
   Bricks with inscriptions are color coded.

Another way to see a brick image and its location on the campus
   site map is to first do a search to find a brick entry and then click
   its individual MAP button.
