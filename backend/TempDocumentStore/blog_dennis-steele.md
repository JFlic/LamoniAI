# Dennis Steele, PhD | Graceland

July 11, 2024

During his time at Graceland, Steele was known as an innovator amongst the faculty – not surprising considering his educational background, which included a bachelor’s degree in mathematics, a master’s degree in philosophy, and a doctorate in computer science.

Steele was a man of many talents. When he joined the Graceland faculty to teach math and philosophy in 1965, he wasted no time making an impact in another one of his great areas of passion: music. Steele helped a group of students organize the New Folk Singers, later known as the North Door Singers, a musical ensemble that toured the United States until 1973. In the 1970s, Steele displayed his own musical talents as part of the faculty quartet, The Unpredictables. In 1978, he created a student musical group called the Graceland Ramblers (originally called the Riverboat Ramblers) that originated as a winter term course. The group was so popular that Graceland funded the annual summer tours of the Ramblers across North America as part of the college’s public relations and recruiting efforts. Steele also helped organize the Saddle Club, a horseback riding group that continued for many years after its organization in 1975-76.

Steele left Graceland in 1984 when he was called back to the West, joining the faculty at the University of Wyoming before finishing his career at Regis University in Denver, Colo. Dennis’ four children – Heather, Chad, Shannan, and Gabe – all shared the stage with him at one time. He is survived by his children, his life partner Molly Myer, his five grandchildren, and the many students that he impacted at Graceland, the University of Wyoming, and Regis, both as a professor as well as a music arranger and producer.
