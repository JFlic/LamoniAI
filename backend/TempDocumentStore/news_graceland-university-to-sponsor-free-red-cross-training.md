On Wednesday, Feb. 18, Creston High School wrestler Tayler Pettit collapsed on the mat during the duals portion of the Iowa State Wrestling Championships at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa. Tayler’s life was saved by the use of an automated external defibrillator and the presence of people who knew how to use it.

Tayler is a part of the extended Graceland family. His brother, Tyler, graduated from Graceland in 2014, and Tayler’s wrestling coach, Darrell Frain, is also a Graceland alum. With such a frightening incident hitting so close to home, Graceland decided to be proactive and offer opportunities for more people in our region to become trained in the life saving skills that saved Tayler’s life.

Graceland University Athletic Training Program Director, Jay Hoffman, said, “At Graceland, we understand the importance of training our students in life saving techniques. In our curriculum, our students have the opportunity to be trained in CPR, first aid, and the use of an automated external defibrillator, or AED. We know that training our students in these types of techniques could be the difference in saving someone’s life.”

Graceland determined more could be done, however. Leaders from Graceland’s Youth Launch Commission provided funding and made arrangements with local hospitals in the region to provide CPR classes at no cost to individuals willing to become certified. It is the hope of the Pettit family and Graceland University that many will take advantage of these training opportunities and help turn what could have been a tragedy for one family into a blessing for many.

Following are the training session locations, dates, and times.

• Decatur County Hospital – July 21 from 5 to 9 p.m.• Clarke County Hospital – July 29 from 1 to 5 p.m.• Ringgold County Hospital – Aug. 6 from 4 to 6 p.m.

There is a limit of 10 participants per class, and registrations will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. To register for a session, contact Emily Uhlenkamp ateuhlenka@graceland.eduor 641-784-5389, and visitwww.graceland.edu/hms/Tayler-Pettit-Project.cfmfor more information.
