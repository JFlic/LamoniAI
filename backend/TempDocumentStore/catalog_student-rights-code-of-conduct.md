# Student Rights & Code of Conduct | Graceland University

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/catalog/student-rights-code-of-conduct#top

As a Christian institution, Graceland University seeks to foster relationships that reflect mutual concern, dignity and individual worth. Consistent with its religious heritage, Graceland’s values of “learning, community, and wholeness” shape the community that we strive to be. Our Code of Conduct reflects these values, and consequently there are some behaviors that are not acceptable at Graceland University. For the sake of clear expectations, those are named below.

JUMP TO

EXPECTATIONS AND VIOLATIONSYou are an important member of the Graceland community. Like all communities, we have expectations about how we live, study, work and play together. All members of the Graceland community are expected to respect one another, to respect themselves, to respect personal and university property, and to respect the principles of integrity, hard work and personal responsibility. With this being the case, the following behaviors have been identified as inappropriate, and a violation may result in disciplinary action. Although specific violations have been identified, it is recognized that other types of inappropriate behavior, which are detrimental to the best interests of the University or members of its faculty, staff, or student body, may be referred for disciplinary review.

Class A Violations

Class B Violations

Class C Violations (Anywhere, Anytime)

Lack of mention in the Code of Conduct with regard to objectionable actions does not imply approval, and may result in disciplinary action.

DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS AND COUNCILSThe following disciplinary hearings and councils have been formed to hear cases based upon where the violation took place, the severity of the violation, and which council, in the opinion of the Dean of Students or designated Residential Life Professional is best equipped to handle the hearing of a particular violation. Students who admit they are “in violation” may ask for an administrative hearing with either a Residence Hall Director (Class A and Class B violations) or the Director of Residence Life or the Dean Students (Class C violations). The administrator has the right to not hear a case. If the case is not heard by the administrator, the case will be referred to the Council on Student Welfare.

The Council on Student Welfare (CSW) is a council composed of faculty administrators and students as outlined in the GSG Constitution. A quorum of five CSW members, with representation from student, faculty, and administrative members is required to conduct a hearing. The Dean of Students or Residence Life Director will serve as advisory members to the CSW. The Council on Student Welfare may hear Class C violations and any case in which dismissal from the University is a possible sanction.

PLEASE NOTE: The Dean of Students may opt to handle any alleged violation at any time. Local authorities may also be called to handle potentially dangerous situations. Actions taken by local authorities will be in addition to disciplinary action by the University.

SANCTIONSGraceland’s values of community, learning, and wholeness guide its approach to justice. We see restorative justice (reconciliation and reparative action), distributive justice (all parties receive what is fair and due), and procedural justice (practical wisdom of due process) over retributive justice whenever possible and practical. The purpose of sanctions is not to punish, but to help a student grow in their understanding of personal responsibility, to protect the community, and to help the student become an accountable member of the community. Consequently, there is no prescriptive formula for applying sanctions, as each student will be treated as a unique individual. Therefore, the list of sanctions below are options for university authorities and councils to consider, but the actual measures taken will depend upon the severity of the violation, pervious offenses, degree of involvement, and individual circumstances. These sanctions and their descriptions shall serve as guidelines for the university and may be modified and used in any combination to meet the needs of the university and the individual student involved.

A record of the disciplinary action will go to the student. A copy of the action will be kept in the Dean of Student’s Office. Disciplinary actions are not recorded on a student’s permanent file unless a student is dismissed from the University.

ACQUITTALStudent is found not to be in violation of the charge against them and the matter is dismissed.

FACILITATED CONVERSATIONIn facilitated conversation, the student found in violation of the Code of Conduct must engage in a conversation with the offended parties regarding the incident in question. The conversation is facilitated by a third party selected by the administrator or council hearing the case.

REFLECTION OR RESEARCH PAPERThe student is required to write a paper that involves research and/or reflection on a matter pertinent to the Code of Conduct violation that they were found in violation of. Students given this sanction will meet with a person designated by the administrator or council hearing the case, in order to discuss the paper.

RESTITUTIONPayment for repair or replacement costs of property damaged or lost. Full payment is due in the Student Life Office within 21 calendar days (three weeks) from the date the sanction is issued.

COMMUNITY SERVICEThe work, not less than five hours and not more than ten hours per violation, may be assigned. Community service may be administered as a sanction in place of or in addition to a fine. It is most appropriate when it is believed that the student will learn the consequences of their actions as a result of the service. It is also appropriate when the action that brought the student to disciplinary review involved a lack of concern for the community. Community service must be completed within 21 calendar days (three weeks) from the date the sanction is issued. If hours are not completed within this time frame, a fine (amount to be determined by the administrator/council) will be applied to the student’s account.

FINESFines will depend upon the severity of the violation, previous offenses, degree of involvement, and the circumstances. Fines may be levied as a sanction according to the following guidelines:

ALCOHOL EDUCATIONOffenders of the alcohol policy may be required to complete an alcohol awareness course and/or meet with a personal counselor.

DRUG RESPONSE PROGRAMThe student will be required to undergo a substance abuse assessment and, if recommended by the administrator of the assessment, must engage in subsequent substance abuse counseling. The expense of the assessment and required sessions will be the responsibility of the student. The initial session must be scheduled by the student within one week from the date the sanction is issued.

ANGER MANAGEMENT COUNSELINGA student issued this sanction will be required to meet with a counselor until released by the counselor. The first session must be scheduled by the student within one week from the date the sanction is issued.

COMPUTER USAGE RESTRICTIONSA student may be restricted from certain privileges for a given time.

PARENTAL NOTIFICATIONA decision to notify parents depends upon the severity of the violation, degree of involvement and the circumstances surrounding the incident Students may choose or may be requested to join the administrator when parental contact is made.

PROGRAM DIRECTOR NOTIFICATIONProgram directors, including coaches, will be notified if a student is in violation of a Class C Violation. The program director may impose further sanctions at their discretion.

RESIDENCE HALL PROBATIONThis is a formal probationary status for a period of time not to exceed one semester. The terms and conditions will be set by the RLC, CSW, Dean of Students or Residence Life Director, depending on the circumstances and the individual needs of the student.

REQUIRED HOUSE CHANGEThe student will be required to change Houses. If the student is living in the residence halls, the student will be required to change floors. The student will not be allowed to attend House-sponsored events of the previous House membership.

CONDUCT PROBATION – Class C OnlyThis is a formal probationary status for a period of time determined by CSW, Residence Life Director, or the Dean of Students. Restrictions and provisions of this probation are individualized to allow for the particular need of the student, the University and/or the situation. The student will be prohibited from holding office in extracurricular clubs and/or house councils. Any further violations while on probationary status means that the student is subject to further disciplinary action.

STRICT CONDUCT PROBATION – Class C OnlyThis term describes a set of conditions making it possible for a student to remain a student in the university in spite of a serious violation. This action is a formal probationary status during which the student is removed from good standing at the university. This status is very near dismissal from the university and indicates the extreme seriousness of the probation. The student will may have one or more of the following conditions imposed when removed from good standing. These conditions will remain in effect until the student is returned to good standing at the university.

DISMISSAL FROM RESIDENCE HALLS – Class C OnlyThe student will be required to move out of the residence halls within 72 hours after issue of this sanction. The terms of the dismissal as well as the length of time this dismissal will remain in effect will be determined by the CSW, Residence Life Director, or the Dean of Students. A student placed on probationary status will be banned from all residence halls and may not attend House sponsored events without the specific permission of the Dean of Students.

DISMISSAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY – Class C OnlyA student may be dismissed immediately from the university for a period of time to be designated by the CSW or the Dean of Students.

APPEAL PROCEDURESAny student found in violation of the Code of Conduct has the right to appeal their case. In cases heard by the Hall Director or the Residence Life Council, appeals will be heard by the Residence Life Director. In cases heard by the Residence Life Director, appeals will be heard by the Vice President for Student Life/Dean of Students. In cases heard by the Council on Student Welfare or the Vice President for Student Life/Dean of Students, appeals will be heard by the Vice President Council. The Vice President Council is composed of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (chair) and one other Vice President (other than the VP for Student Life).

If a student wishes to appeal a decision, they must submit a written appeal within three days (72 hours) after the student has been notified of the decision. Appeals will be heard based on the following:

Questions concerning policies or procedures may be directed to Dave Schaal, Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students (dschaal@graceland.edu).

Harassment of students is not tolerated at Graceland University. Harassment undermines the mission of the university through its insidious and detrimental impact on individual students, faculty, staff and on the university community as a whole. Harassment stifles the realization of the victim’s full potential as a student, faculty or staff member.

Harassment is especially serious when it threatens relations between faculty and student or supervisor and subordinate by unfairly exploiting the power differential between the parties in the relationship. Likewise, Graceland University does not tolerate harassment between people of equal university status.

Additional information is available in the Dean of Students Office to all current students, and to any applicant for enrollment. Please review the Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy is availableonlineor in the Dean of Students Office.

Graceland’sMissing Student Policyis designed to guide a collaborative response if a student living in university-owned, on-campus housing, who based on the facts and circumstances known to the university is determined to be missing.

Anyone who believes a residential student is missing needs to report their concern to the Dean of Students’ Office which will investigate each report and make a determination whether the student is missing.

A student will be deemed missing when he or she is absent from the University for more than 24 hours without any known reason. This policy is in compliance with the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008.

Each residential student will have the opportunity to identify an individual to be contacted by the university in case the student is determined to be missing. This confidential, emergency information will be available to the Dean of Students and may be updated at any time by the student inMy Graceland.

If a missing student is under the age of 18 the university is required to notify the parent or guardian of the missing student no later than 24 hours after the determination by the Dean of Student’s office that the student is missing. The Dean of Students’ office will also notify the Lamoni Police Department no later than 24 hours after it is determined a student is missing.

Faculty, students and all other persons associated with Graceland University are prohibited from distributing and/or displaying in any manner, including but not limited to the mail, computer transmission or posting, of any material that is obscene or profane. This is not intended to prohibit the use of materials that may have an obscene or profane content for demonstrable educational purposes. Accessing obscene or profane materials in public areas is forbidden. The determination that material is inappropriate is at the sole discretion of the university and will be made based on the university’s understanding of prevailing community standards. Violation of this policy will result in referral to the Dean of Students office for disciplinary action.

Graceland University takes photographs and videos of students throughout the year. These images often include students in classrooms, residence halls, micro labs, athletic events and other university activities. Graceland University reserves the right to use these photographs and videos in the promotion of the university. Students who enroll at Graceland University do so with the understanding that photographs may be taken that would include them and these photos may be used in university publications, websites, newspapers and other media for promotional purposes only. Names of students may also be released to the press regarding student involvement in academic and extracurricular activities.

Severe disciplinary action will be taken against persons tampering with security and safety equipment or other acts that put the campus community at risk (e.g. loaning an ID card to someone else for unauthorized entrance to a building, propping a locked door open or allowing unauthorized access to secured areas).

Please see the Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Policy availableonlineor in the Dean of Students office by request.

The selling of items or solicitation of funds, by anyone including students, is prohibited on campus. Any exception to this policy must be cleared through the Council on Student Life. If you are approached on campus to make a purchase, please notify your Residence Hall Director or the Vice President for Student Life/Dean of Students.

The university may dismiss or remove a student whose mental or physical condition constitutes a threat or undue burden to himself/herself or others. A student may also be suspended/expelled for cause if his or her actions are found to be detrimental to the university community. In case of suspension/expulsion for cause, the student will receive failing grades for the semester. Re-enrollment requires permission from the Dean of Students.

### Grievance Procedure for Students**

- In an informal procedure, the university official will counsel the complainant concerning options and, at the complainant’s request, may help the complainant mediate the complaint informally.
- If the complainant chooses to proceed with an informal complaint, the university official will inform the accused person(s) of the nature of the complaint, identity of the complainant and the actions available. If the complainant chooses not to proceed with an informal or formal complaint, no written record of the complaint will be kept.

Unsuccessful resolution moves the matter to the formal procedure level of mediation. The process of complaint, response, and mediation will not normally exceed ten calendar days.

The investigator shall be authorized to interview witnesses identified by any party. Upon completion of the investigation, the investigator will provide a written report of the formal investigation which details the findings and any recommended actions.
