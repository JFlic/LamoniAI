Since putting down roots in Carthage, Missouri, the Sacry family has had a big impact on their hometown.

Dr. Roger ’89 and Patty Wilkinson ’89 Sacry and their two daughters, Isabella ’20 and Gwyneth ’22, moved to Carthage in 2004 when they found the cozy community checked all their boxes. “We’ve always loved small town,” Roger said. “We liked the school system, and we liked that we were near a larger city.”

Over the years, the Sacry family has established businesses in Carthage. Roger’s private practice, Sacry Family Medicine, expanded in 2012 with a medical spa, The Pavilion. This past August, the Sacrys opened a Tropical Smoothie franchise for two reasons, according to Roger. “We value the healthy food options and like the positive, uplifting environment of the cafés.”

The Sacrys’ investment in the community of Carthage is exciting to them. “Carthage has a ton of things going for it, but we’re always thinking of ways to strengthen the bonds of community that already exist,” Roger said.

He continued, “I’ve always been interested in empowering people by building relationships. The goal is minimizing isolationism — so, the opposite of that is building community, promoting togetherness and upholding diversity. Looking back, a big motivator was my father, Gayle Sacry, MD, ’56. He is also a physician and community leader in Whitehall, Montana. He was often involved in community activities and projects. He’s my motivating guide for my career choice and for striving to improve my community.”
