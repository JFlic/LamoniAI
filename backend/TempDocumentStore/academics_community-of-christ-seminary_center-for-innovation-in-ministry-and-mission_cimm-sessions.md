The Center for Innovation in Ministry and Mission (CIMM) presents live classes exploring theology, culture, and Community of Christ Identity, Mission, Message, and Beliefs in “bite-sized” sessions. These no-cost live sessions will take place most Wednesdays at 7 p.m. CST.

These classes can be used as discussion starters in adult classes or for personal spiritual/educational development.
