Serving those who serve.

More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site athttp://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill.

Graceland is proud to have earned the designation of Military Friendly for three years running. We are committed to providing active military and veterans with opportunities to further their education in a variety of relevant programs. Graceland University is a Department of Defense Memorandum of Understanding signatory member and supports the Principles of Excellence.

JUMP TO

Active military and veteran students have the same admissions requirements as other students.

In addition, Graceland University:

College credit for active military service may be requested by any veteran by making application to the Registrar.

Simplifying the Cost of College

Understanding the cost of college can be challenging. Graceland is much more affordable than most people think, and we want to ensure our tuition price is closer to what people actually pay. So we are transforming our base tuition price on the Lamoni campus from $32,500 to $19,950 beginning in the 2024-25 academic year.

Military and veterans who receive VA educational benefits can work with the registrar or other certifying official to activate them. Students eligible for veterans’ benefits should inform their admissions counselor and they will connect you with the appropriate certifying official.

Our aim is to help make college more affordable for all our students. Learn about the scholarships, grants and financial aid we offer and apply today.
