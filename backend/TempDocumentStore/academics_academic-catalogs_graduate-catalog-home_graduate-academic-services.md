Graceland University is committed to full compliance with the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). As part of the implementation of this law, the university will continue to provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities so that they can participate fully in the university’s educational programs and activities. Although Graceland is not required by law to change the fundamental nature or essential curricular components of its programs, the university will provide reasonable academic accommodations for qualifying individuals.

Students who qualify for accommodations are encouraged to contact the Office of Student Disability Services before classes start or as early as possible. The office will work with the course instructor and the student to arrange for reasonable accommodations. Students are required at their own expense to provide documentation verifying disability. All information for accommodations can be foundhere.

A college education can be strenuous, and many students need academic assistance. We offer a variety of programs on the Lamoni Campus including writing and tutoring assistance.

Writing Center:The Graceland University Writing Center provides a supportive, welcoming environment where all Graceland students can work together with a trained tutor on improving both their writing and speaking knowledge and skills. The Writing Center assists students in all majors and at any stage of the writing and speaking process to become better, more confident writers and speakers. The Writing Center offers both face-to-face tutoring (for students on the Lamoni campus) and online tutoring (for all Graceland Students). You can get an appointment or see the Writing Center schedule by visiting our My Graceland page at:https://my.graceland.edu/ICS/Student/Writing_Center/or by emailing the Writing Center atwritingcenter@gracleand.edu. Lamoni students are also welcome to come by and have a drop-in appointment. Tutoring locations will be held in a variety of locations on campus that are convenient for students. Additionally, if no tutoring times work in your schedule, please emailwritingcenter@graceland.edu, and if possible, other tutoring arrangements will be made

Tutoring Support:Lamoni campus students may request tutoring for any class a tutor is available and that is regularly attended by students in the class. These sessions are often in a group setting and offer a supplement to the course including study skills/tips, and important review of course concepts and materials. Tutors are hired and trained by the Director of Writing and Tutoring. These tutoring sessions are held online or in person. If group tutoring does not work in your schedule, or you feel that you may need extra support, please emailtutoring@graceland.eduand if possible, other tutoring arrangements will be made.

You can see the tutoring schedule by following this link:https://my.graceland.edu/ICS/Student/Tutoring/. If you need tutoring for a class that does not appear on this schedule, please contact the Director of Writing and Tutoring at tutoring@graceland.edu and if possible, other tutoring will be provided.
