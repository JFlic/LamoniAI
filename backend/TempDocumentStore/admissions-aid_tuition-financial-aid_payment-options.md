Save Your Spot for Fall 2025 on the Lamoni Campus

Which option is best for you?

All payments are due in U.S. funds.

Full payment or participation in an approved payment plan is required on or before the first day of class. A penalty may be assessed for late arrangements. If you fail to be financially cleared, you risk being dropped from enrollment and possible institutional withdrawal. Accounts that become past due will be assigned an Accounts Receivable Hold, which will prohibit changes in registration and/or release of transcripts.

The easiest method to cover your balance is to make a single, one-time payment. This can be done online, or payment can be mailed to:

Graceland University, Student Financial Services, 1 University Place, Lamoni, IA 50140.

Graceland is pleased to offer an easy, interest-free payment plan for either an individual semester or the full academic year. If you wish to take full advantage of this monthly payment plan, we urge you to make application by June 1 for full-time undergraduate programs and prior to the beginning of your first class for part-time or graduate programs. Late enrollment in the plan is accomplished either by reducing the number of payments in the plan or by sending two or three months of payments to catch up on the plan. Apply for a payment plan by contacting your student financial advisor.

Payment Plan options include:

Note: There is a $50 non-refundable processing fee.

Parents of dependent students may apply for a Federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) to help pay their child’s education expenses as long as certain eligibility requirements are met.

A private education loan is a consumer loan offered by banks, lending companies and other private entities for the purpose of paying college expenses. Graceland University does not recommend or endorse any private loan lender.

### Provision for Military Veterans who have provided Certificate of Eligibility*:

In compliance with Section 103 of the Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018, Graceland University will not impose the following penalties to covered individuals** due to the delayed disbursement of funding from the Department of Veteran Affairs:

This provision does not cover any balance remaining in the amount of the student’s financial obligation to the university and the amount that the student is eligible to receive from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The student is required to make payment for the difference.

*Certificate of Eligibility is defined as a Certificate of Eligibility, a Statement of Benefits, or a VAF 28-1905

**Covered individual is defined as any individual who is entitled to educational assistance under Chapter 31, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, or Chapter 33, Post 9/11 G.I. Bill®
