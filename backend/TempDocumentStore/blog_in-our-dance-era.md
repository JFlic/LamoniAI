Graceland Gadets Make Historic Debut at Nationals

July 12, 2024 | Georgia Seagraves, MS, ’21

Coach Kat Albertson eagerly awaits the scoring to be announced after the team performed at nationals.

Kat Albertson’s journey in dance is as dynamic as her coaching style. Competing from a young age and leading her college team at Central Michigan, Albertson’s passion led her to a successful stint coaching at her high school alma mater. When the opportunity at Graceland arose, she saw a chance to make a significant impact. “I was drawn to the role at Graceland because it was a chance to build a program from the ground up,” Albertson shared.

Her coaching philosophy is simple yet profound: “Relationships and positive leadership come first. I’m competitive, don’t get me wrong, but I put people first. Watching them grow as individuals is my top priority,” she explained. This approach has reshaped the team’s dynamic, fostering a supportive and ambitious environment.

The journey to nationals was no small feat for this spirited squad. Despite being newcomers on the national stage and often starting competitions with the disadvantage of performing first, the team’s dedication to setting clear, achievable goals and developing habits to support these objectives played a pivotal role in their success. Coach Albertson emphasized the importance of regular goal-setting and reflective practices, such as journaling after each practice to evaluate progress and adherence to their set habits. This structured approach enhanced their performance skills and fortified their mental resilience, enabling them to advance to NAIA Nationals — an accomplishment never before achieved by a Graceland dance team.

The team was required to master intricate routines blending 30 seconds each of pom, jazz, and hip-hop styles, culminating in a compelling and technically challenging performance. “We tweaked our dance after every competition, learning and improving together as a team,” Albertson noted. Their persistence paid off, earning them a 10th-place rank nationally at the end of their season and a spot at nationals, where they impressively finished 7th out of 12.

Co-captain Carleigh O’Dell ’25 shines for the crowd gathered at Morden Center to send the team off to nationals.

Coach Albertson credits much of their achievements to the team captains Bryce Clausen ’25 and Carleigh O’Dell ’25, third-year members who provided crucial leadership. Their ability to mentor and support the younger members was vital in navigating the season’s challenges. Albertson also emphasized the incredible encouragement the team received from Graceland Gadets alumni. “The support from alumni and our community has been incredibly moving. Their encouragement has made this experience even more special,” Albertson gratefully acknowledged. The team also engages with supporters through their active Instagram account, sharing updates and behind-the-scenes content.

As the Graceland dance team looks to the future, their sights are set not just on maintaining their competitive edge, but on continuing to build a program that values growth, unity, and excellence. This historic journey to the nationals is not just a testament to the team’s hard work and dedication, but also a beacon of what’s possible under leadership that values both personal growth and competitive success. The Graceland University dance team is leaping into a promising future, and they’re just getting started.
