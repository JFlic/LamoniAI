Dr. Sehwan Kim, Assistant Professor ofSport Managementin theC.H. Sandage School of Business, recently attended the2024 National Collegiate Sales Competition (NCSC)in Kennesaw, Ga.

The NCSC is the longest-running university sales roleplay competition in the United States and ran from March 7 to March 11, and Dr. Kim accompanied two students as their advisor: Camry Dillie ’24 and Harrison Sellars ’25.

72 universities nationwide and provided over 200 students, including Camry and Harrison, with the opportunity to test their sales skills, build networks with corporate sponsors, and access internship and job opportunities. As their advisor, Dr. Kim guided the two attending Graceland students as they competed in the sales roleplay competitions.

How Camry and Harrison experienced the competition, in their own words:

“I was honored to attend and compete at the NCSC. Leading up to the competition, we practiced twice a week in mock sales scenarios. Arriving at the competition, I was in awe. It was so much more than I could have ever imagined, with hundreds of students from all over the world and so many different companies looking for talent. I was fortunate enough to land an on-site interview with this year’s event sponsor, Gartner. I got valuable feedback from multiple judges with extensive experience in sales on how to better my ability to sell to customers. My favorite part of this experience was the career fair. I connected with so many different professionals within the sales industry in many different sectors and have been able to keep in touch with them and start applying for full-time positions at their companies. I am so thankful that I was able to attend this event and recommend it to anyone who is looking to pursue a career in sales.”Camry Dillie ’24

“This conference was a great opportunity and chance to learn more about sales and meet some great companies and networks in the process. Coming into this competition, it was apparent how spectacular it was, everyone was professional from the students to the staff. The all-around service made us feel like VIP. The whole conference was very well put together and we were treated very kindly. When it came to the actual competition, I felt very prepared through our practice of mock scenarios as a research and consulting firm. Now that I have gone through this competition and spectated the finals, I feel more confident and understanding of how this competition works. I learned a lot from our coach, as well as other sponsors, and of course during the competition itself. I gained real-world sales experience that is completely different from past experiences such as internships. I believe this conference has gotten me prepared for my career after college.”Harrison Sellars ’25
