Graceland’s academic divisions add new majors and programs to give students the OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE their passions and pursue their dreams in highly sought-after career fields, accelerated graduate degrees, and a new hybrid doctoral program in physical therapy.

Beginning in the fall of 2023, two exciting new majors will be offered.Digital Content Creationis a unique interdisciplinary program combining communication, creative arts, and writing to provide students with a well-rounded education in the content creation field. The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects employment in media and communications jobs to grow 6 percent over the next decade, and the salaries are increasing rapidly as companies prioritize social media, video production, and content creation. This unique program will feature hands-on learning opportunities, internships, and a capstone course to give students the skills and experience they need to succeed in their careers.

Graceland’sMarketingmajor is the newest offering from the C.H. Sandage School of Business (SSOB) and caters to students interested in careers in strategic marketing, sales, and other similar occupations. Marketing is an in-demand degree, and this program builds on the popular programs that already exist in the SSOB, leveraging the talents of the new faculty members like Assistant Professor of Business Ioseb Gabelala, DBA, who brings knowledge of international business marketing to the department. Graduates will be well-prepared to enter the workforce and make an impact.

The SSOB also added a newFinancemajor for those interested in careers that require financial analysis, risk assessment, and strategic planning to contribute to the economic success of businesses and other organizations. The program is built on coursework in finance, economics, mathematics, and accounting that will provide students with strong quantitative, critical, and analytical thinking skills. Students will graduate the program equipped with career-focused, field-specific finance content that features experiential and simulation-based learning grounded in a professional code of ethics.

These new majors were developed by faculty with an eye toward relevance and growth, and they are made even more valuable with theTransformational Leadershipmajor. A second major that all students receive as part of their undergraduate education, Transformational Leadership combines general education, leadership, and strategic skills courses. This bonus major provides Graceland students with a well-rounded education that is rooted in the liberal arts and readies them for the next step in their lives, regardless of their chosen career path. The National Association of Colleges and Employers published eight Career Readiness Competencies, and Graceland’s Transformational Leadership major explicitly develops all eight, setting up its students for success in the workplace and lifelong career management.
