Graceland University’s Health and Wellness Promotion Graduate Assistant, Kailey Boden ’21, recently partnered with Tim Brunner, Parks and Recreation Director from Lamoni, to host an Art Walk promoting physical activity and literacy.

“When people think recreation, they often focus on sporting events. However, recreation is much deeper than that. Sports aren’t for everyone, and that’s completely okay. Using other avenues such as art walks, the trail systems, community improvement projects, etc., are all great ways to enjoy exercise, stay active, and be involved in the local community,” said Brunner.

Boden, currently the Health and Wellness Promotion Graduate Assistant at Graceland University, continued, “I think the art walk was a great avenue to help kids recognize how easy and fun it is to be active every day. This art walk hopefully helps kids see the importance of not only exercising our body but also our minds as well, as physical and mental health go hand in hand for our overall health and well-being.”

Boden graduated from Graceland in 2021, majoring in Allied Health with an Applied Health Science concentration, and is currently pursuing her MS in Nutrition and Human Performance at Graceland University.
