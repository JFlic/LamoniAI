Resch Scholars Program

With the creation of the Resch Scholars Program and in partnership with the Richard J. Resch Foundation, Graceland establishes an endowment to recognize industrious students excelling in the sciences through their hard work. This program honors Resch’s legacy of success throughout his life from humble beginnings.Graceland will award full tuition scholarships in the areas of biology, chemistry, data science and analytics, computer science, and health & movement science. Numerous partial scholarships will be awarded to students with preference given to first generation and underrepresented groups in the sciences.The establishment of this program will provide new funding to recruit top-notch science students to engage in the sciences in the state-of-the-art Resch Science and Technology Hall at Graceland’s campus in Lamoni, Iowa.

“Richard Resch’s support of Graceland over the years has advanced the University’s mission in ways that will be felt for generations to come,” saidGraceland President Patricia H. Draves, PhD. “As a scientist myself, I am personally grateful to Richard and his foundation’s generosity, ensuring our students in the sciences have access to an unparalleled experience that sets them up to become transformational leaders and change makers the world needs.”
