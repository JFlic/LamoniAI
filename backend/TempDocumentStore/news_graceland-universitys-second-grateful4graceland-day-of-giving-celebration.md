The Graceland University and surrounding communities are invited to the Graceland University Lamoni campus, and the rest of the world is invited to join via our live stream videos and on social media, to celebrate the second #Grateful4Graceland Day of Giving celebration on Tuesday, March 21. The celebration will be centered in the Memorial Student Center (MSC) Main Room from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. and will include fun activities, games, free popcorn, and live interviews and performances. You can find more information, including a schedule of the day’s entertainment and games, and the link to watch the entire day live, atwww.graceland.edu/grateful4graceland.

People who join the event on campus will enjoy free popcorn and performances by the Graceland University chamber singers, jazz band, strings, cheer and Gadets, all of which will also be streamed live onGraceland University’s Facebookpage. For those on site, there will be the opportunity to take part in competitions for hula hoop, basketball, golf putting and billiards, and BINGO will be played between 5-7 p.m. Participants may put their name in a drawing for great prizes including $50 gift cards, a 50” smart TV, GoPro camera, Apple Watch, a UE Boom 2 Brain Freeze wireless mobile Bluetooth speaker and more.

A live phone bank will be taking gifts as alumni and friends call in, and the online giving will be reported throughout the day, including onGraceland University’s Twitteraccount. A pool of matching challenge dollars have been provided by five donors to match all donations that come in the week of March 21. Donors 40 years old and under will be matched 2:1, tripling the original gift. All others will be matched 1:1; doubling the impact of each gift.

Graceland will harness the power of social media –Facebook,Twitter,Instagramand Snapchat – to connect the local Graceland community with the rest of the world throughout the day, so whether you’re able to join us on the Lamoni campus March 21, or you choose to express your gratitude from somewhere else, you are encouraged to use the hashtag to share your story and the reason YOU are #Grateful4Graceland.
