Not the message in a bottle kind for you fans of The Police.

Anyway, on to the blog.

Life is a funny thing sometimes.

College life is an even funnier thing … all the time.

Here we are, thrown into a situation with more responsibilities than we’ve ever had (laundry, what?), making some of the biggest decisions we’ll ever have to make, all while trying to stay on top of school, work, outside activities and social life in the present, and trying to decide on and plan out what we’re going to do in the future (like, pizza or subs tonight?). Not to mention that we’re still trying to really figure out who we are, what our beliefs and values are, and dealing with relationships that have become even more complicated (which we never thought could be possible before) because we’re moving into a stage where it’s “gonna be forever or it’s gonna go down in flames.” #TSwiftKnowsBest (<-My boss made me say that..)

Here we are, adults, but just barely. We’re not incapable; we’re just clumsy, which is to be expected because everything is so new to us. It’s okay to be unsure. It’s okay to break down. It’s okay to make mistakes. (Like that one time you did that one thing…yeah, that’s ok too – people will forget, I promise.) It’s okay to change your mind. It’s okay to feel lost. It’s okay to need help. That’s what this new blog series/hashtag is for.

#GUSOS is aimed at providing help for students at a time when it’s needed most, when students might not want to ask for help, and when students might not know what to ask. The goal is to provide information, tips, and the experiences of others to help individuals through one of the most unsure times in their lives. Information from self-help articles, therapeutic techniques, student testimonies, blogs and all kinds of other sources will be used to create a useful, relatable and, of course, humorous self-help package — because laughter is the best medicine, right?
