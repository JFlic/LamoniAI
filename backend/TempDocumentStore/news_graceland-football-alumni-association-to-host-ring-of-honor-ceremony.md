June 27, 2023 | Georgia Seagraves

Graceland University Athletics and Graceland Football Alumni Association (GFAA) are excited to announce the creation of the Ring of Honor and the first annual induction ceremony. The Ring of Honor is an exceptional group of individuals who played football at Graceland University and members of the Graceland football community who made significant contributions to their team and the University both on and off the field. This honor is especially meaningful as the recipients are chosen by their peers and former teammates who recognize their hard work, leadership, and dedication to Graceland’s football team.

This year’s honorees are Former Head Coach William (Duke) Dudek ’65, Russell Bruch ’82 QB, Charlie (Chaz) Seefeldt ’84 LB, and Jeff Criswell ’86 OT. The GFAA has planned a special Ring of Honor weekend at Graceland University on September 15-16, 2023, to celebrate their outstanding contributions to Graceland’s football legacy. It will be an unforgettable experience with exciting events for all alumni and supporters.

“It is undeniable the impact these gentlemen have had on the Graceland community,” said Graceland University Athletic Director Brady McKillip. “The Ring of Honor award and ceremony weekend will be a valuable tradition to honor these exceptional players and members of the football community for years to come.”

The Graceland Football Alumni Association invites all interested individuals for an exciting weekend of festivities, providing a unique opportunity to reconnect with fellow football alumni.Visit their websitefor further insights into the Graceland Football Alumni Association and its activities. Stay connected through theGraceland Football Alumni Association’s Facebook pagefor additional updates and announcements.

The festivities will begin on Friday night with an awards dinner. On Saturday, all registered football alumni are invited to join the team for a pregame meal, followed by a spirited pep rally and tailgating before the game against Missouri Valley, starting at 6:00 p.m. At halftime, there will be a special ceremony to honor the inductees of the first Ring of Honor class.
