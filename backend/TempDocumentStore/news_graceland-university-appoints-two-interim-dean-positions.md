April 28, 2014

Graceland University is pleased to announce that Scott Huddleston, Ed.D., will be appointed Interim Dean of the Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education, effective July 1. Scott earned his Doctor of Education from the University of Missouri-Columbia, and has been with the Graceland School of Education (GSOE) for four years. He chaired the Diversity Committee for the school this year, and has served on the university Curricular Adjustment Committee (CAC) for three years.

“I’m very excited about the opportunity to work with the School of Education. There are some outstanding individuals and educators in our school, and we will be busy preparing for our next accreditation visit in 2015,” stated Huddleston. “One of my strength areas is recruiting, marketing and attracting students to our program.” His experience and accomplishments with the School of Education resonate with the vision he brings to the position, noted Graceland president Dr. John Sellars.

Huddleston will replace Dr. Tammy Everett, who was recently appointed Vice President of Academic Affairs. “Scott has led preliminary work on developing a leadership degree for the graduate program and has extensive experience in online education,” stated Everett. Huddleston will work closely with Tammy, beginning June 1, on the self-study for accreditation.

Dr. Steven L. Anders, Dean of the C.H. Sandage School of Business and Interim Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS), will continue his interim dean role until a national search is completed to hire a full-time CLAS dean. Dr. Anders has served as Interim Dean since June 2013.

Dr. Anders continues to bring flexibility and experience, as he fills the needed interim position. Anders stated, “I have enjoyed working with the division chairs on the CLAS Council this year. However, it is important for the faculty in the College of Liberal Arts and Science to have their own dean. They want and deserve this. Until then, I will continue to work with and support the CLAS faculty and the CLAS Council as best I can.”

A national search will begin early in the Fall 2014 semester to fill the SOE and CLAS dean positions.
