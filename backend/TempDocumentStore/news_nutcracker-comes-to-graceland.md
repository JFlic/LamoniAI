LAMONI, IOWA (November 13, 2012)—The Owen/Cox Dance Group of Kansas City will present “The Nutcracker and the Mouse King” in a special Christmas concert on Friday, December 7, 7:30 p.m. at Graceland University’s Shaw Center.

General admission tickets for performance are $10. Special, reserved seating is available for $25 each. Reserved seating is limited–act promptly to place your ticket order today!

To get tickets, stop by the Shaw Center Ticket Office, call 641-784-5270, or purchase your tickets online atwww.graceland.edu/shawtickets.

The family-friendly production highlights many traditional “Nutcracker” favorites, like “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” and “Waltz of the Snowflakes,” but you will experience contemporary mixes of music and choreography. Students from the Kansas City-area Paseo Academy of the Performing Arts join the ensemble in presenting a familiar story that turns out to be not so familiar after all.

Returning to the original and notably darker E.T.A Hoffman story, The Nutcracker and the Mouse King (1816), this production will feature original music and radical rearrangements of Tchaikovsky melodies created by a host of innovative Kansas City jazz musicians, as well as the award-winning choreography of Jennifer Owen.

This is the fourth season Owen and Cox have performed the production.

Arrive early before the performance to explore the $16-million Shaw Center expansion, just dedicated in October 2012.
