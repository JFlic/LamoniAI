The Postgraduate Certificate program enlarges the focus of nursing, using as its foundation the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree. Students admitted to the Postgraduate certificate program are not matriculated for a graduate degree. A certificate is received upon completion of the coursework and graduates are eligible to sit for national certification/credentialing exams. The Postgraduate certificate program is primarily provided via the internet. It is designed to allow practicing RNs to pursue further graduate work within their home community. Students complete the requirements for certification through a combination of online courses and preceptor guided practicums in the student s community. All students are required to attend a focus session at the Independence campus.

The AGACNP concentration focuses on preparing nurses to perform in the expanded APN role caring for adult & gerontology populations in acute and chronic care settings. The student’s area of study incorporates a blend of theory and research with an emphasis on guided practice in clinical areas. The curriculum builds on the core master’s courses with the addition of essential FNP courses. All didactic and clinical courses are planned following the guidelines of the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties (NONPF) to meet the requirements for national certification.
