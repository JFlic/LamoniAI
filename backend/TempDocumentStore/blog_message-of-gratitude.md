Offering my thanks to all the members of our Graceland community

November 22, 2023

In this season of gratitude and reflection, I want to take a moment to express my deepest thanks to all Gracelanders, far and wide. Thanksgiving is a time to appreciate the warmth of our community and the blessings that surround us.

I am grateful for our students who bring energy and enthusiasm to our campuses and their studies every day.

I am grateful for our incredibly talented faculty and staff whose commitment to building an environment of radical belonging truly makes Graceland a special place.

I am grateful to our alumni and friends who support Graceland both financially and through their care for the institution we all love. Your stories of this University always bring me joy.

As we gather with friends and family to celebrate Thanksgiving, let us cherish the moments of togetherness and reflect on the positive impact we make in each other’s lives. May your holiday be filled with joy, laughter, and the warmth of shared moments, whether with family or friends.

Happy Thanksgiving.

– President Pat Draves
