Cydney Stables, a sophomore at Graceland University from Gaston, Oregon, is competing in the Future Farmers of America (FFA) national competition for theAgricultural Proficiency Award in Agricultural Sales – Entrepreneurshipand is one of four people in the nation to be nominated for this honor.

The Agricultural Proficiency Award in Agricultural Sales – Entrepreneurship award is based on a member’s Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE). It recognizes individual skills and career-based competencies developed through multiple years of participation in immersion-type SAE projects. In 2020, a family friend had their florist cancel on them for their wedding; Stables came to the rescue with her experience in horticulture and floriculture and was able to provide all floral decorations for the special day. After this experience, she opened her own floral business, “Flowers by Cydney,” an enterprise that ultimately took her to the finals for the Agricultural Proficiency in Agricultural Sales – Entrepreneurship competition.

To submit her project for the award, Stables created a portfolio containing everything about her business, from financial statements to product pictures, life skills, budgeting, sales, a contacts list of the connections she made, and projects she completed within her business.

“When I was a 17-year-old high school student starting up my own flower business, I never imagined it would receive a National award. Being a contestant among the top 4 in the Nation is an amazing and exciting opportunity. I am grateful for all the support from my family and friends, including the Graceland Agribusiness club and Graceland community,” said Stables.

Stables majors inAgricultural-Business, Communications, andSustainabilityand participates on Graceland’s basketball and golf teams. The Graceland community is cheering her on as she prepares for nationals in October in Indianapolis, Indiana.
