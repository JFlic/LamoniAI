The Graceland UniversityC.H. Sandage School of Businesshosted several high schools from Missouri and Iowa on November 15, 2023. The annual event incorporates agricultural business and other simulations for students interested in pursuing education and careers in a variety of industries.

Originally focused on supporting students interested in agricultural business in the area surrounding Graceland’sLamoni, Iowa campus, the event has grown to include 240 students from 14 high schools.

C.H. Sandage School of Business Chair Jeff McElroy, EdD, addresses high school students

The goal of the event is to bring agricultural and business-minded high school students from the surrounding area together to learn about agriculture, business skills, leadership, and future opportunities in education and employment.

Rosa Sondag, who teaches agriculture and is the Future Farmers of America advisor for Central Decatur schools, said, “Attending Graceland University FFA/AG Day provides agriculture students the opportunity to expand their knowledge of agriculture through interactions with leaders in the industry, but also through networking with Graceland Professionals and Students.  It also provides students the chance to observe the college experience at Graceland University.  I encourage each of my sophomore and junior students to take part in this experience and have always been excited about the feedback that I receive following the event.”

Scott Valentine, a business teacher in the Seymour Community School District was enthusiastic about the event and said, “Our students wouldn’t stop talking about the incredible experiences they had with the Sports Marketing Activity! The Graceland University students were so personable and worked great with the kids, and our students were able to polish their people skills while collaborating with their peers to create and promote their marketing plans!!! Five Stars – would highly recommend!!!”

The following schools were represented at the event:

GracelandAgricultural Business Professor Emeriti Max Pitt, MBA, called the event a success, saying, “From Graceland students leading Team Building to the ‘Ultimate Football League’ business simulation and from Lamoni Livestock Auction and Iowa Corn’s experts to NRCS’s Rainfall Simulator, high school students came to learn and to enjoy the day. The Ag Instructors and Business Instructors from the high schools and their bus drivers brought 240 students and 70-degree temperatures to make Ag Business/FFA/School of Business Day at Graceland an unprecedented success.”
