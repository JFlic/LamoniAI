# Bachelor of Arts Degree in Sustainability Studies

The Sustainability Studies program at Graceland is a hands-on, innovative and interdisciplinary program designed to prepare students for a range of careers in the sustainability field. It is also rooted in Graceland’s general education curriculum, which makes it easy to add a double major or explore other academic interests.

In addition to the General Education requirements, the interdisciplinary major in Sustainability Studies requires 36 s.h.

Core course requirements 21 s.h.

Course Required for General Education 4 s.h.

9 s.h. of electives from the following list. Minimum 6 s.h. need to be upper division.

Internship requirements 3 s.h.

Capstone/Senior Seminar/Senior Project requirement 3 s.h.

Programs, including internships, will be overseen by a standing Sustainability Studies Committee with a consistent chair who serves as a point person.

Recommended that Sustainability students takeMATH1370 Statistics for SciencesandECON1320 Principles of Microeconomicsas part of their General Education requirements.

Sustainable International Agriculture explores global issues, incremental and transformative steps toward sustainable agriculture, international development opportunities, current agricultural industries, educational pathways, and career options. Content includes emphasis on understanding the need for agricultural infrastructure and production, embracing sustainability, and appreciating broad-based, liberating (essential) education. ELO4 Global Learning - Sustainability

Contemporary and traditional approaches to clay with emphasis on wheel-throwing and hand-building techniques. Exploration of sustainable production practices will also address surface decoration and responsible firing processes. Studio fee required. ELO5 Arts - Sustainability

An introduction to the fundamentals of sustainability and its impact on biological systems. Explores how sustainability relates to population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history. Practical approaches to this course will be tied closely to small-scale agriculture and water use with hands-on fieldwork at the campus EcoPlot. ELO6 Science - Sustainability

An exploration of the biotic and abiotic components of the environment, including the biological, physical, and chemical processes that shape natural ecosystems (e.g., biogeochemical cycles). The course will also examine the impact of human population growth, resource use, emissions production, and technological innovations on the environment. Current environmental issues, such as loss of biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, air and water pollution, and climate change, will be considered.  Additional fee required. ELO6 Science -  Innovation, GE3D Liberal Learning-Natural Sciences

A study of how organisms interact with one another and with their physical environments at the physiological, population, community, and ecosystem levels. Case studies will use ecological concepts to develop conservation strategies for species, habitats, and ecosystems.  Includes a lab.  Additional fee required. EL06 Science - World Citizenship, ELO6 Science - Sustainability

This course will extend scientific knowledge to understand how nature and the environment influence communication and society. Students will learn about significant environmental controversies, from toxic waste to climate change, to pro-environmental behaviors. Using a foundation of persuasion, the course focuses on social responsibility and the history of mediated communication within the context of environmental movements and human-made crises.

Students will learn theoretical and practical foundations related to geographic information systems and spatial analysis. Emphasis on teaching students to integrate and analyze spatial information from various sources. Includes a weekly laboratory section. Prerequisite: MATH1380.

Analysis of the fundamental principles of the American economic system, centering on price, production, market structures, and a survey of contemporary economic problems, e.g. sustainability. ELO5 Social Science - Sustainability

Who is most hurt by environmental degradation and abuse, and who benefits? This course will examine what contemporary literature from the United States and around the world has to say about environmental racism, ecofeminism, and settler colonialism. We’ll also think about the social construction of nature, globalization, food justice, and urban ecological issues. Our guiding question is simple: What is the role of art in the struggle for social change? This course emphasizes critical thinking, historical and socio-political contexts, and diverse aesthetics.

A transnational survey of films that deal with environmental issues and, more broadly, with human relationships to the nonhuman world. An examination of the impact of urbanization on rural communities, the mysterious allure of wild and uncultivated landscapes, the threat of climate change to daily life around the world, and the cinematic representation of environmental apocalypse. Explores different genres and styles, including neo-realism, eco-horror, anime, and avant-garde cinema. ELO5 Humanities - Sustainability +This course is only offered every other year.

What makes a work of literature "environmental"? How have humans thought about nature throughout history, and how does that intellectual and artistic history affect us today? Can works of literature help humans prevent environmental catastrophes like climate change and species extinction? We'll seek answers to these questions as we engage with fiction, nonfiction, drama, and poetry. We'll discuss the ways that literary and cultural forms can shape who we are, what we value, and what we imagine for the future. We'll also work to build your skills of critical reading, analytical thinking and persuasive writing, skills that will serve you in the future, in whatever environment you inhabit. ELO5 Humanities - Sustainability.

An examination of the complex relationship between human society and nature from early settlements to the present in what is now the United States. Important topics include the impact of human settlement, population growth, use of land and natural resources, the effects of industrialization, and the development of the conservation and environmental movements. ELO5 Histories - Sustainability, GE3B Liberal Learning-Histories.

Data analysis and measures of central tendency, dispersion, and correlation. Introduction to probability. Estimation and hypothesis testing. Bivariate regression. ANOVA. Introduction to nonparametric techniques. ELO6 Math, GE2B Foundational Skills-Mathematics/Quantitative.
