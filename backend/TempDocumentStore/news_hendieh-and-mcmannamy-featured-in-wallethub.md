Understanding the factors, formulas and data that make up insurance pricing gives consumers orientation on how much they should expect to pay for coverage. Hendieh points out that 62% of drivers in the USA are paying more than necessary for car insurance.

Both Hendieh and McMannamy conclude with the advice to actively shop around for more accommodating insurance companies and packages. This just as importantly signals to providers that prospective and existing customers are becoming smarter about their actual individual coverage needs.
