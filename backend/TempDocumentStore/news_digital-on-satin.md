Lilith Smith’s multi-layered artistic vision on mixed media is open for discovery at the Constance Gallery.

February 12, 2025 | Samantha Perryman (Senior student, major: Graphic Design)

The Constance Gallery at the Helene Art Center is currently hostingthe exhibitionRib is a Shell, Heart is the Yolkby acclaimed artist Lilith Smith.This evocative showcase features a collection of Smith’s most compelling works, blending digital collage, painting, and embroidery to explore themes of memory, touch, and sensuality.

Smith’s artistic journey is one of passion, mentorship, and creative discovery. From her early days as a commercial design student to her emergence as a celebrated studio artist, her work is a testament to the transformative power of art. Her pieces, often created on fabrics like satin and chiffon, are soft, intimate, and layered, inviting viewers to engage with themes of identity and personal connection.

“I allow for surprises to happen in the production process, which keeps me engaged,” says Smith. Her work is both poetic and tactile,combining traditional techniques with modern digital artistry to create pieces that feel timeless yet contemporary.

The exhibition presents several standout works, including:

Smith’s artistic success was shaped by the mentorship of a professor during her undergraduate studies at Fairmont State University. “Seeing (my professor’s) work really made it clear to me that this was a possibility,” Smith recalls. This encouragement led her to transition from commercial design to studio art, where she found her true calling.

The sense of community she discovered in art school has been a driving force in her career. “The enthusiasm from people who cared about making things as much as I did was contagious,” she says. These connections have remained a source of inspiration and collaboration throughout her career.

For aspiring artists, Smith offers this advice:“Work a lot. Make as much as you can, especially early in your career. Ask yourself, what do I care about as a citizen of the world? Who am I within the scope of that?”

Rib is a Shell, Heart is the Yolkis a captivating experience for art enthusiasts and newcomers alike, andon display at the Constance Gallery until March 7.Graceland Artsoffers a virtual gallery on Instagram:@gracelandu_art.
