When Stu Sherman, ’85 presented Lysle Gilmore,‘36 with a plaque announcing April 29 as Lysle Gilmore Day for Graceland University, Lysle smiled and said, “…Wow!”

Lysle was 100 years old on Tuesday, April 29, 2014. He made a trip back to “the Hill,” along with several members of his family, to commemorate his birthday and to visit Graceland. He had stories to tell of times during his school years and his involvement in the Friday Night Percolators Club. The men’s social group met to “talk about things and drink coffee,” explained Lysle with a grin.

Lysle Gilmore Day will be remembered along with a Graceland legacy Lysle passes on to his great, great nephew, who will be a freshman at Graceland University this fall; a 4th generation Gracelander.
