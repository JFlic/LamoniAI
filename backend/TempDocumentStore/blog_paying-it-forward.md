Health Ministries Association (HMA) incorporated Community of Christ’s values, beliefs, and practices as components in motivating persons toward health and wholeness. Their mission was to encourage and empower leaders in the integration of faith and health in their local communities. When the organization’s leaders decided to retire, they wanted to make an impact on the future by donating their funds to a worthy cause. They approved the Graceland University Resolution on October 12, 2023, to reallocate the remaining HMA funds — providing an endowment of $100,000 for undergraduate nursing scholarships at Graceland University.

The Health Ministries Association was funded by membership dues and donations during its existence and upon the decision to dissolve, they were faced with allocating the remaining funds.

The organization partnered with Graceland to use their $100,000 gift by establishing theCommunity of Christ Health Ministries Association Joan Scribner Pratt Memorial Endowed Nursing Scholarship Fundto aid undergraduate nursing students who meet the scholarship guidelines. The fund remains open and can receive additional donations at any time. This enables other generous Graceland graduates and friends to contribute to this endowed scholarship and help future nurses earn their degrees.

“The endowment funding will help students achieve their goal of becoming a Registered Nurse, and I am beyond grateful that the association picked Graceland to carry on the Health Ministries legacy through this scholarship.”

JOLENE LYNN, PhDFormer Dean, School of Nursing

Kathryn Minton, one of the HMA members, said, “Health Ministries Association is proud of its past accomplishments in providing health and education to thousands of recipients over the last 47 years. Because of the dedication of members, donors, and the HMA Board of Directors, HMA was able to provide a $100,000 endowment to the Graceland University School of Nursing. An education endowment has been a goal of HMA for many years, and it was our honor to give those funds to Graceland University as the well-deserved recipient.”

Graceland University is grateful for the HMA’s years of partnership and is grateful to carry on its legacy. Through the endowment, the School of Nursing can increase access to qualified nurses who may need assistance in attending.

Do you want to give to this scholarship or another endowment?Graceland has nearly 300 endowments that support the university in four areas — faculty, institutional, program, and scholarships — which means that by preparing for our future, we are helping Graceland students to better theirs.
