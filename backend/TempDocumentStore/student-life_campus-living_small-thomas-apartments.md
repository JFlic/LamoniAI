# Small & Thomas Apartments | Graceland University

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/student-life/campus-living/small-thomas-apartments/#top

The apartments are named after Richard Small and Norma (Thomas) Small. Their generous donations helped make the building of the apartments possible.

The Small & Thomas Apartments are single-gender apartments with co-ed buildings and are available to upperclassmen only. There are a limited number of openings each year.

Interested students must put their name on a list in the Residence Life Office by April 1 to participate in the apartment selection night. Student names will be called in order of their merit-based ranking. In descending order, merit rank is based on classification, behavior on campus (violations of the Code of Conduct), GPA and credit hours earned.

There are a limited number of 4-person apartments available each year. In these apartments, students will need to share a bedroom with another student. For the 4-person apartments only, the University provides bunked twin XL beds, two desks and two chairs in each of the two bedrooms. The 4-person rate includes the cost of these furnishings.
