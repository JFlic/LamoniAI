The night was laid out from the entrance; a glorious evening. An elegant beginning on the red carpet, ending on the runways last walk, each showcasing exquisite design. Splash Seafood Bar and Grill held the Des Moines Fashion Week finale Friday, Sept. 29 in Des Moines, Iowa. Lavish Jaguars perched to greet you with their latest models provided by Jaguar Land Rover, Des Moines; other generous presenting sponsors such as Josephs Jewelers to make this event possible. Set right across from Des Moines Crusoe Umbrella, guests and VIP viewers alike stood posh and trendy, poised and eager to view the evening’s offerings.

Des Moines Fashion Finale presented up to 18 designers, including Josephs Jewelers, Margie Trembley, Eyebeads and Gemstones, J Brownlee, Hannah Swanson, Lord Midas, Terri Buckner, Miranda Hanson, Emily Pillard, Kate Waltz, Mitchell Henderson, Carter White, Amour and Dan Richards. Boundless designs and striking models; the word that lingers would be no other than “passion.”

Delicate, rich fabrics of silk and chiffon accented with embroidery, beads and jewels. Colors of cream, cool hues, green and pink pastels; patterns floral and exotic. Models confident and heads held high displayed refreshing and contemporary perspective on the runway that captivated us, yearning for more.

Ruching skirts and drop waistlines extenuated designer Miranda Hanson’s bold collection. We couldn’t help but fall in love with her blush-pink lace dress with a scalloped neckline and double-layered skirt — but my jaw dropped when we laid eyes on what had to have been Hanson’s most astounding design yet: a sleeveless, rose-bordered, plunging V-neck bodice with a pearl-colored iridescent glow. The skirt of this dress pulled the whole dress together flawlessly if there was any argument. Overlapping lace that displayed sparingly revealing; teasing with just enough leg.

Camille Renee; DSM’s Executive Producer couldn’t have created and conquered a better night for all of us. Leaving with inspired minds and excited hearts, Runway Avenue looks forward and beyond in covering Des Moines Fashion Week for many years to come.
