The Student Support Services – TRIO program is sponsored by Graceland University and funded by a U.S. Department of Education grant. TRIO provides opportunities for academic development, assists students with basic university requirements and serves to motivate students toward the successful completion of their postsecondary education. The goal of TRIO Student Support Services is to increase the retention and graduation rates of its selected participants. Program eligibility is based on Department of Education income guidelines and first generation status (meaning whoever raised the student did not have a four year Bachelor’s degree} or documented disability. The TRIO Program provides tutoring, academic advising, STEPS courses, financial literacy training, assistance applying for and understanding financial aid, peer mentoring, and advocacy. Eligibility does not insure program selection. Students can find an online application to TRIO in My Graceland once enrolled at Graceland University.

Graceland University is committed to full compliance with the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). As part of the implementation of this law, the university will continue to provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities so that they can participate fully in the university’s educational programs and activities. Although Graceland is not required by law to change the fundamental nature or essential curricular components of its programs, the university will provide reasonable academic accommodations for qualifying individuals.

Students who qualify for accommodations are encouraged to contact the Office of Student Disability Services before classes start or as early as possible. The office will work with the course instructor and the student to arrange for reasonable accommodations. Students are required at their own expense to provide documentation verifying disability. All information for accommodations can be foundhere.
