As you read in the previous issue of Horizons, construction will begin this spring on the renovation and expansion of the Memorial Student Center (MSC) as it is transformed into Newcom Student Union.

This exciting change highlights our efforts to invest in the student experience in significant ways. The MSC is the hub of our Lamoni campus and is used by arguably every student, faculty and staff member on campus.
