CHAPTER  IV

Janetta  only  stayed  long  enough  to listen  to  a  few  polite  inquiries  as  to whether  she  had  suffered  any  incon­ venience  from   the  accident,  then  ros3 and asked leave to  retire  for the  night.

"You  can  go  if you  wish,' said Clarice;  'but  please  don't  imagine  th a t Harry  and  I  always  need  to  be  left together. I  am   generally  down  in  th6 drawing  room in  the  evening. To­ night  was an  exception,  Good-night. Tell  me  if  you  are  not  comfortable."

Captain  Merivale  rose  and  opened the  door.

Then  Janetta  bethought  herself  th at i t   w ould  only  be  courteous  to  retu rn down-stalrs  and  wish  Mrs.  Mortimer good-night. She  found  her  seated  be­ fore  the  flre,  reading  a  novel.

'The  interview  was  a  long  one,  aud therefore  I  conclude  successful,'  she said,  laying  down  the  volume.

"Miss  Seymour  is  quite  delightful, and  kinder  than  words  can  say,'  an­ swered  Janetta  eagerly.

'And  you  feel  the  w orll beneath Your  feet9 So  it  may  be  for  a  time. You  will  be  the  reigning  favorite,  ju st because you  happen  to  be  blessed  w ith a  handsome  face and  figure. Prize them  whilst  you  have them;  when you lose  them  the  world  will- pass  you  by.'

'The  world,  perhaps;  but  not  those whose  love  oue  has  won  already. I shall  think  poorly  of  myself  If  I  bave not  made  a  single  friend.'

I t   w as  th e   second  effort  Janetta  had made  in  their  brief  acquaintance  to reach  Mrs.  M ortimer's  sympathy;  ap­ parently  it  failed.

"Shall  you  like  it  when  you  see  an ­ other  step  into  your  shoes?"

Janetta  rose. I  am  very  tired. Will you think it rude of me if I go to bed?' she said,  not  answ ering  the  question.

Mrs. Mortimer's  attitude towards  her did  not  greatly  disturb  her. She  had a  bright,  wholesome  nature,  and  felt it  possible  to  outlive  the  lady's un­ spoken  jealousy.

Besides,  the  days  th a t  followed  w ers so  full  of  delightful  and  exicting  ex­ periences  th a t  she had  no  time to trouble her  head  w ith  w hat Mrs.  M ort­ imer thought  about  her.

Clarice  Seymour  had  taken  an  im ­ pulsive  liking  for  her  new  companion, and  poured  tokens  o£  lier  favor  upon her. The  very  difference  of  character between  the  girls  possibly  made  them .greater  fi lends. l

Janetta  was  strong,  self-reliant,  and self-contained,  even-tempered,  and  ac­ customed  to  give  help  rather  than  re­ ceive  it;  Clarice  was  capricious  as  the weather-one  day  all  smiles  and  sun­ shine,  the  next  at  war  with  herself and  the  world,  railing  a t  the  fate  t h i t kept  her  helplessly  tied  to  the  sofa.

Yet  through  all  her  varying  moods she  possessed  a  fascination for all about  her;  and  Janetta  condoned  her fretfulness  and  waywardness  for  the grace  and  charm   th a t  peeped  out  con­ stantly,  even  in  her most Irritable moments,  like  specks  of  blue  sky  on a  cloudy  day.

"How  old  are  you?"  asked  Claries ■suddenly,  when  Jan etta  had  been  with ,  h er  for  about  a  week. "I  believe  you arejfears  younger  than  I  am,  and  yet you have a'kind  of motherly  way  w ith me  when  I'm  wicked  and  cross,  as  I am  today."

'I 'm  tw o-and-tw enty,'  said  Janetta, with  a  laugh.

'And  I  am  four  years  your  senior, aii*  yet  I  feel  as  If  I  wero  a  child  an.l you  a  woman;  you  are  so  tall  and strong,  and  you  make  me  feel  com­ fortable  even  when  you  are  sitting in  th e  room. You  are  making  me  a monster  of  selfishness. Do  you  know you've  scarcely  been  out  of  the  house since  you  came?'

'I  don't  w ant  to  go  out. I'm  never dull  with  you.'

"live  told  H arry  it  m ust  not  go  on," said  Clarice. "I've  sent  him  off  to hire  a  bicycle  for  you,  and  he'll  take you  out;  it  will  cheer  you  both  up. I wonder  sometimes  if  Harry  will  get tired  of w aiting  for  me-do  you?"

'I  think  the  very  fact  that  you  are delicate,  and  need  so  much  petting and love,  would  m ake  me  love  you  all  the more,'  said  Janetta.

'Ah!  th a t's  a  w om an's  view. I  won-der  if  it's  H arry 's I often  w ant  to ask him,  and  I'm  such  a  coward  I  dare not. If  he  w ants  his  freedom  he  m ust ask  for  it;  I  will  n o t  give  it  him .'

'I  think,'  Janetta  said,  rising  to rearrange  Clarice's  cushions,  "if  you fret  yourself  over  im aginary  ills  you won't  be  down  tonight.'

"I  shall  if  you  leave me  quiet!'  cried Clarice, who had  not ceased talking for the  past  hour. "You'll  promise  tn a t you'll  go  out w ith  H arry?'

'Oh,  yes;  I 'll  go  if  you  like,'  said Janetta,  who  was  learning  that  the simplest  way  of  m anaging Clarice  was to  humor  her  whims.

She  looked  such  a  picture  of  grace and  strength  when she came  down Teady  equipped  for  her  ride,  in  a  n eat­ ly-made  coat  and  skirt  of  some  dark material,  relieved only  by  a  brightcolored  ribbon  in  her  sailor  hat,  th a t Captain  Merivale  gave  her an  involun­ ta ry   glance  of  adm iration.

"My  mistress'  orders  are  that  I'm  to take you for a good long ride,' he said, wheeling  round  Clarice's  bicycle.

"She  says  she  has  kept you too tightly  tied  to  h er  sofa.'

'It  is  the  place  w here  I  like  best to  be,'  Jan etta  answered,  with  perfect sincerity.

Yet the sw ift ride through the bright sunshine  of  the February  afternoon was  real  enjoyment,  and  tho  compan.   ionship ftf a  clever,  cultivated  man

like  Captain  Merivale was intellect­ ually  Invigorating.

They  were  racing  along  the  broad road  th at  stretched  like e white  iin? fur  miles  along  the  top  of  the  cliffi when  Jenetta  began  to  slacken  speed.

'Tired  a t  la st? '  cried  H arry,  w ith  a trium phant laugh.  '1  thought  I  would just  let  you  have  your  fling. You must  be  magnificently  strong  to  keep up  a  pace  like  th at.'

"I  am  not  tired  now,'  retorted  J a ­ netta,  w ith  shining  eyes  and  flushed cheeks. "I  could  go  on  for  miles  and miles,  but  Miss  Seymour  will  be  glad to  see  us  back."

"Do  you  know  why  I  brought  you this  way?'  asked  Harry.  w*th  a  sud­ den  change  of  tone. 'Wo are  c.'ose  to tho very spot where Clarice was thrown  over  the  cliff  on  to  that  pro­ jecting  ledge  of  rock  th a t  you  can  see if  you  get  off  your  bicycle  for  a  m in ­ ute.'

Janetta  jumped  off,  went  to  the  edge of  the  cliff,  and  peeped over, with shuddering  interest. 'I wonder  she was  picked  up  alive! Were  you  with her?'

'Yes,"  replied  H arry  shortly. ' It was  hard  lines  on  us  both,  wasn't  it? We  had  been  engaged  just  a  month'.'' 'She's  getting  better,  isn't  she?'

'I do not know. Sometimes I think-'

Harry  came  to  an  abrupt  pause,  and Janetta  did  not  ask  him   to  finish  his sentence.

They  pursued  their  way  home  at  a more  sober  pace,  and  Janetta  felt  th e brightness  of  tho  day  had departed with  tho  relation  of  th a t  sad  little story.

They  found  Ciarice  on  her  couch  in the  drawing  room,  every  vestige of  illtemper  gone,  looking  her best  and brightest,  arrayed  in  a  new  gown  of soft  texture  and  bewitching hue.

"Yes,  I  hope  you  are  going  to  say something  nice  to  me,'  she  said,  w ith an  arch  sm ile  at  her  lover. "I  had  It made  as  a  glad  surprise,  and came down partly  to gratify  my  own  vanity, and  moro to  annoy  Doctor  Drake,  who told  me  to  stay  upstairs  this  evening Instead,  I've  invited  him  to  dinner and put  on  a  new  frock.'

"I  care  little  for  the  motives  th a t brought you down, as long as I find you looking  so  happy  and  pretty,  if  I  may give expression to a truth," said H arry, sitting  down  by  her  sofa. "Mrs.  Mor­ timer,  will  you  be  kind  enough  to give  us  some  tea? We  are  hungry and  thirsty  after  our  ride.'

Mrs.  M ortimer  looked more glum than  usual. She  had  employed  her  af­ ternoon  in  lecturing  Clarice  upon  the impropriety  of  sending out Janetta with Captain  Merivale, and Clarice had answered her remonstrance with merry,  derisive  laughter.

"I'm  not  afraid  to tru s t themHarry  is  going  to  m arry  me;  but  if you  feel  like  th a t,  dear  Mrs.  M ortimer, take  a  tricycle  and  follow  after  them ,' she  had  rem arked,  a  little  flippantly.

"If harm comes of it------' 'No  harm   will come,' interposed Clarice,  a  little  sharply. "Janetta  is the  soul  of  honor,  and  of  H arry  there is  no  need  to  speak.'

"You  have  known  her  for  a  week,' said  Mrs.  Mortimer.

"And  she  is  as  easy  to  read  as  a book,'  Clarice  had  said. And  there the  subject  dropped.

"I'll  tell  you  a  secret,  H arry,"  said Clarice,  when  they  were  left  alone  for for  half an  hour's  chat  before  din­ ner. "I've  ordered  a  new dress for Janetta-an evening dress-such a pretty  one,  and  it's  on  her  bed  ready for  her  to  p u t  on  tonight. I  want  her to  look  her  best. She  knows  nothin;; about  it.'

'Will  she  wear  It,  do.  you  think?' asked  H arry,  a 'little  doubtfully.

'I  shall  be  furious  if  she  doesn't. I  want  Doctor  Drake  to  take  a  fancy to  her.''

'So  th a t's  it,  is  it-you  are  turning into a matchmaker? A  dangerous

game, Clarice.  I advise you to drop it." To  Clarice's intense mortification Janetta,  who  did  not  come  down  until the  dinner  gong  sounded,  appeared  in the  simple  black  dress  th a t  she  wore every night. Neither  did  she and  Doc­ tor  Drake  seem  to  find  interests  in common;  for  although  he  took her  in to  dinner,  and  talked  to  her  as  in courtesy  bound,  when  he  came  into the drawing room afterwards  he seated himself  by  Clarice's  sofa,  and  devoted himself to  her for  the  rest  of  the  even­ ing.

## CHAPTER  V.

"Janetta,  I'm  going  to  call  you  by your  Christian  name  and  you  can  call me  Clarice,'  announced  Mi&s  Seymour the  following  morning.

Janetta  looked  up  from   her  w riting with  a  sw ift  shake  of  the  head. ' 1 should  like  you  to  call  me  Jauet.ti, but  I  prefer  to  call  you  Miss  Seymour.

"I've been  w aiting  for  your  faults  to crop  up. I feared  you  hadn't  any; but  I've  found  you  out  now-you've a  very  nasty  pride.'

Janetta laughed merrily.  "How have I  shown  it? '

"Twice  already. You  didn't  put  on th a t  new  dress  last  night,  you  decline to  call  me  by  my  proper  name  today.'

Janetta's  colors  came  and  went.  "Did it  seem  horribly  ungrateful? I  had  a hard  struggle  with  myself  before  I knew  w hat  to  do,  and  then  it  seemed quite  clear  to  me  th a t  I  m ust  keep  m y Independence,  and  wear my own clothes  as  long  as  I  can  earn  money enough  to  provide  them. You  are  so kind  and  good  to  me  th a t  you  ijn o ra

my  true  position;  but  I  m u st  remem­ ber my own, and respect its  conditions. It  Joes  not  seem  fitting  to  ta k e  your gifts  and  call  you  by  your  nam e  when I am  really  your  paid  com panion. W p are  not  on  equal  term s."

"It  seems  to  be  a3  if  we  wave  oi> very  equal  term s,  both  of  us  are  or­ phans-at  least,  I  th .n k   yoa  to lj  m? th a t  you  had  neither  fath er n o r mother living.'

'Yes,  they  are  both  deaa,'  said  Jan etta  shortly.

'And because  I  happen  to  have  mou money than you,  why  should  you  m.n if  now  and  then  it  pleases  me  to  giv you  things? I  lia \e   n o t  m any  p.cas ures.'

' You  don't  really  know  me,  you  sei In  your  generous,  im pulsive  fashioi you've  invested  me  v/.th  var.ous  qua ities  which,  as  you  know   me  bctte you'll  find  I  do  not  po.;s  so.'

"You  think  my  friendship  is  lik Jonah's  gourd-that  it  wUl  w ither  i a  day  or  so,'  said  C*arlce  petuiantl.

Whatever  topic of conversatic might  be  started,  Ja n etta  n o tic e i  th; i t always  veered  round  to  one  or  tw subjects-either  Captain  Merivale,  o the likelihood  of  C larice's recover) With  a  heart  at  l>.sure  trom   Use she  grew  day  by  day  more  painfuh interested  in  what  the  future  migh hold  in  store  for  th 2 tw o  w hose  lovi story  was  being  enacted  before  he eyes.

Sometimes  she  suspected t h a t thi passion  of  devotion  m ust  alw ays  hav bepp.  more  on  her  side  th  vn  his. H manner to  her was gr-c.-fu  y  affection ate;  but  for  herself  she  felt  th a t  sh would have demanded someihint warmer  from  the  man  she  was  goln^ to  marry.

'I  shall  go  to  India  w ith a muc. easier  mind  now  that  I  know  Claric has  some  one  w.th  hor  who  w.ll  mak her  life  so  bright,"  said  C aptain  Meri vale  one  afternoon,  as  they  were  re tu rn in g   from  a  walk  by  th e   sea

'It  is  good  of  you  to  say  th a t,'  Jan etta  answered. 'I need  not  assur. you  that  I'll  do  everything  I  can  to make  Miss  Seymour  happy She's  thi kindest friend I  ever  had,  and  I'n. glad  I've  got  to  know  you  so  well, j like  to  think  that,  when  she  g jts  hot t e r and  you  marry,  I  shall  feel  tha I  may  keep  you  boih  as  friends  '

Captain  Merivale  did  not  answ er  foi a  minute,  and  Janetta  glanced  up  a him  a  little  UMasily,  and  saw  tha he  had  turned  rather  white.

' Yes,"  he  said carelessly, 'we'vi been  capital  friends  ever  since  ws  me in  th a t  curious  way  on  th e  railway and  I  pulled  you  through  the  window

Janetta  felt  puzzled  and  h u rt  by  hit manner. His  tone  was  studiedly  in different,  and  he  referred  po.ntedly  tc what  had  been,  rather  than  to  wha. might  be  in  the  future She  though: with  bitter  mortification,  th a t  in  he. eager  sympathy  with  him   and  Claric. she had  proffered  friendship  w hich  hau evidently  been  regarded  as  an  import inence.

'With  all  my  boasted  Independence I'v e   forgotten  my  position,'  she  saiu to  herself  reddening  w ith vexation, but  her  resolve  was  taken  a t  the  risl, of  vexing  Clarice,  she  would  have  n' more  walks  or  talks with Captair Merivale.

She  did  not  make  her  w ay  as  usual to  Clarice's  room  th a t  afternoon  when she  came  in  from  her  walk. She  felt as  in  her  inward  annoyance  m ight  find expression  in  her  face. She  was  con­ siderably  surprised  as  she  entered  her bedroom  to  hear  the  quick  shutting  of a  drawer,  and  Mason,  w ith  some  ap­ pearance  of  confusion,  began  to  close th e   window  and  draw  th e  blind.

Janetta  was  certainly  not  suspicious by  nature,  but  the  g irl's  m an n er  made her  feel  certain  th at  she  had  been tampering  with  her  things.

When the Marquis of  Lansdowne was governor-general  of  C anada  he  had  tc make  a  speech  to  the  French-Ca.nadians,  says  M.  A.  P. With  all  Its  loy­ a l t y to  the  English  connection,  this l i t t l e   b it  of  tra n s p o rte d   F r a n c e   adheres very rigidly to many things  French,and especially  to  the  purity  of  th e  French tongue-at  least  as  it  was  spoken  in t h e   eighteenth  century. Few  viceroys have  ever ventured accordingly  tc leave  the  safe  security  of  th e   English tongue,  and  it  was  w ith  som e  trepida­ tio n   th a t  the  F re n ch -C an ad lan s  heard t h a t   Lord  Lansdowne  w as  going  to  de­ liver  a  speech  to  them   in  th e ir  own language But he  had  scarcely  uttered th e   word  'messieurs"  w hen  the  whole audience  hurst  into  cheers,  they  rec­ ognized  at  once  the  accent  of  the  true French  tongue,  the  accent  only  possi­ ble  to  a man  of  French  blood,  and  one who  had  spoken  French  aa  hie  mother tongue. It  is  perhaps  th is  accom plish­ ment  which  had  som ething  to  do  with Lord  Lansdowne's  latest  appointm ent. When  some  one rem onstrated w!th Lord  Salisbury  for  retain in g   the  two oflices  of  prime  m inister *and  foreign secretary,  his  reply  was  th a t  he  could not  help  himself,  there  w as  b u t  one member  of  his cabinet who  could speak French,  and  th a t  w as Lord Lansdowne.  And now  Lord  Lansdowne will  receive  the  foreign  am bassadors every  Wednesday  afternoor  and  what­ ever  else  may  be  found  fault  w ith,  his French  will  be  faultless.

The  customs,  traditions  and  super­ stitions  connected  with  Easter  are  al­ most  Innumerable. Their  origins  are in  many  ci.ses  Impossible  to  determine, because  they  evidently  took  place  at  a time  when  the  season  was  still  pagan in  Its  character. Otners, again,  are  di­ rectly connected  with  the  Christian  ob­ servance  of  the  festival. The  early Christians  in  many  countries  used  to greet  one  another  on  Easter  morning with  the  salutation.

'Christ  is  risen.'

The  reply  to  this  was"

'Christ  is  risen,  indeed,  and  hath appeared  to  Simon."

"This  custom,  it  is  said,  is  still  ob­ served  in  the  Greek  church

The  giving  ot  eggs  at  Easter,  or  tho spring  festival,  is  one  of  the  most widely  known,  as  it  is  also  one  of  the oldest,  of  the  customs. From  the  re­ motest  times  the  egg  has  stood  to  the Eastern  nations  as  the  symbol  of  the universe,  and  its  breaking at  that  time has represented  the  opening of  tho  new life of  the  year. When  tho  custom was  carried  over  Into  Christian  prac­ tice  the  Easter  eggs  were  usually  sent to  tho  priest3  to  be  blessed  and  sprin­ kled  with  holy  water. In  later  times the  coloring  and decorating of tho eggs  was  introduced,  and  in  a  royal

## Children's  Easter

1

It  was  the  Saturday  before  Easter, and  the  children  all  ran  out  to  tho barn  to  hunt  eggs,  with  Egypt,  the tame  crow,  hopping  after  them.  Nan­ ny  was  sure  there  must  be  several dozen  eggs  in  the  hen  house,  Billy thought the haymow was the best place to  find  them,  and  K itty  said  she  had seen  old  Topknot  flying  out  from  Dob­ bin's manger. Egypt said  nothing.

<!-- image -->

OUT  IT CAME WITH A LOUD 'OW!' but  I  rather  think  he  knew  as  much about  the  nests  as  they  did.

Egypt  was  a  sly  old  fellow. He liked  buttons  and  pennies,  but  he  had the  greatest  fancy  for  pins. He  would pull  them  out  of  every  pin  cushion  In the  house  when  he  could  get  a  chance, so  you  m ight search through room after  room,  and  not  come across a single  pin. Nobody  knew  what  he  did with  them  all. He  was  fond  ot  eggs, too,  and  I  am  afraid  this  was  the  rea­ son  th at  the  children  had  such  a  long hunt  for  them,  and  found  so  few.

At  last  they  climbed  up  the long lad­ der  into  the  mow The  hay  was  piled almost  to  the  roof  and  covered  the windows. It  was  so  dark  that  Nanny and  K itty  were  a  little  bit  afraid,  but Billy  went  first,  floundering  along  in the  hay,  ju st  as  you  wade  through  a snow  drift.

"Guess there are  nests on  this  beam,' said  Billy,  "but  it's  so  dark  I  can't see. I 'll  feel '

In  th e   la s t  few  years  artificial  egg3 of  candy,  china  and  other  m aterials, and  egg-shaped  articles  of  all  kinds, have  largely  replaced  the  real  eggs  as Easter  gifts. The  shop  windows  each

year  at  th is  season  testify  to  the  in­ genuity  expended  in  devising  new  and attractive  objects  In  which  tho  idea  of the  E a ste r  egg  shall  be  preserved. In Paris  these  Easter  presents  are  gener­ ally  given  on  the  first  day  of  Passion Week. All  are  emblematic  of  eggs, and  are  know n  as  'oeufs  des  Paque,' or  'P aschal  eggs."

In  w ent  b illy 's  hand,  and  out  it  came in  a  second,  w ith  a  loud  'O w'"

" I t 's hornets  or  yellow-Jaclcets or something!'  'he  screamed. 'Fetch  tho barn  lan tern ,  Kit,  and  I'll  knock  'em out!"

Kitty  brought  the  lantern,  and  then ran  to  th e  other  side  of  the  barn,  for fear  of  th e  yellow  jackets. Billy  held the  len tern   over  his  hear  and  peeped in.

What  did  he  see? Not  hornets,  but pins.

He  had  run  his  hand  into  Egypt's own  little  ' hldy-hole,"  where  the  sly little  rogue  had  laid  away  a  whole  pile of  his  fav o rite  treasures. No  wonder they  pricked  lilcc  horneto. But  ■what the  queer  old  bird  was  saving  them   for I  never  knew .

## Origin  of  Easter  Hats  I

©5XS®®®SX5XS®^

To  neglect  the  putting  on  ot  some entirely  new   article  of  dress  on  E as­ ter  Sunday  was  regarded  by  the  Eng­ lish  of  olden  tim es as  sure to  bring bad luck,  and  certainly  this  is  one  of  the practices  w hich  has  lost  nothing  with the  increase  of  years. Only  now  It  has been  slig h tly   altered,  so  th a t  to  have no  new  clothes  to  exhibit  at  the  E aster parade  is  considered  sufficiently  bad luck  in  itself,  without  the  fear  of  any further  m isfortunes that  may  result from  it. After  donning their new  Eas­ ter  g a rm e n ts  the  English  country  peo­ ple  dined  off  tansy  pudding  and  bacon or  tansy  pudding  and  "good  red  her­ ring,"  tho  tansy  being  the  symbol  of the bitter herbs  commanded  to  bf eaten  a t  th e   Paschal  feast.

## Live  Easter  Eggs.

Sam Lee was a  great chicken-fancier, for  a  small  boy,  and  like  m ost  people with  a  fad  had  no  patience  w ith  the fads  of  others; so  when  one  day  he  ' was  telling  his mother  of  a  lovely brood  of  bantams  he  had  seen  ('Not much  bigger  than  bumblebees,  m other, honest'"),he was  provoked  when  Grace came  in  with  a  basket  of  eggs  to  color for  Easter,  and  took  off  his  m other's attention  by  her  questions.

"Easter  eggs'"  he  scornfully said. "W hat  good  are  they? You  can't  eat 'em! You  can't  hatch  'em! I t 's   all j u s t nonsense''

Grace  retorted  hotly,  and  a  quarrel seemed very near  Indeed;  but ju st then grandma  snapped  her  Angers  sharply, in  a  funny  way  she  had. Mother said, "There,  another  thought  has struck grandma!'  and'they  all  laughpd,  and the  'war-cloud'  rolled  away.

Easter  morning,  when  Sam  came  to breakfast and  found  at  every  plate but his  a pretty nest of  moss and  wild  flow­ ers  holding three colored eggs, he wouldn't have owned to feeling neglected  and  left  out,  but  he  did! More  than  that,  the  family  certainly looked  at  him  w ith  a  quter  smile,  and grandma  even  left  the  table  'smiling all  over  her  face." Could  it  be  they were smiling at  his  discomfiture?  Sam plucked  up  pride,  and  even  was  gener­ ous  enough to  adm ire the baskets.

'When  he  w ent  to  his  room  to  get ready  for  church,  he  saw  th e  Joke! There  on  his gas-flxture hung  two large,  handsome,  egg-shaped Chinese lanterns,  just  w h at  he  had  wanted.

"Ah!'  said  Sam, "there's where grandma's  thought  struck!'

He  started  to  tak e  them  down,  and heard  a  strange scrambling sound' Hastily  opening  them,  out  fluttered  a tin y   pall*  of  silv er  bantam s,  an d the little   rooster  flapped  his wings  antf crowed!

' H urrah!"  cried  Sam,  as  he  dashed

"THERE'S  W HERE  GRANDMA'S THOUGHT  STRUCK."

downstairs  to  p la n t  a  resounding  kiss on  each  of grandma's  soft  cheeks. "Those  Easter eggs  are something lik e !'-Lizzie  E.  Johnson.

Scliooll>oy'»  T r i b u t e   t o   B u r r o u g h s . How  close  th a t  veteran friend of birds and animals  and  trees,  John  Bur­ roughs,  gets  to  th e  heart  of  m ankind is  illustrated  by  a   letter  w hich  he  re ­ cently  received  from   a  schoolboy. The letter,  as  printed  In  an  article  by  Clif­ ton  Johnson in  Outing is as follows;  'I recently  got one of your  books  through the  mail,  marked  'second-class  m at­ te r.' But  it  isn 't  second-class  m atter. I  h ave read  it,  and  it  is  first-class  m a t­ ter. The  binding  and  get-up  m ay  be second  class,  h u t  the  m atter  is  firstclass.' The  boy  wrote  to  John  Bur­ roughs  as  he  would  write  to  any  other boy  friend  whom  he  considered  had been  dealt  with  unjustly. He had read the  book,  and  he  knew, and  w anted  to' assure  his  friend,  th a t  w hat  he wroU was  first-class  m atter  in  s p ite 'oT what any -postmaster  'general  said.
