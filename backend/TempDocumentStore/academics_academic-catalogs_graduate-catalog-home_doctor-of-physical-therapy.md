The Graceland University Doctor of Physical Therapy program delivers an innovative, evidence-based, and student-centered curriculum in a community where all belong. Best practices in hybrid education, grounded in cognitive neuroscience for learning, are used to provide students with the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities to become licensed physical therapists while also emphasizing clinical reasoning development and professional formation from the onset of the program. The programs accelerated, hybrid model removes barriers to accessing physical therapy education, increases flexibility for traditional and nontraditional learners, and enhances the quality of student engagement. Students, Faculty, and staff are innovative, inclusive, accountable, reflective, collaborative, and inquisitive professionals on a shared journey to develop physical therapy practitioners adaptable to meeting the needs of today’s ever-changing healthcare environment.

The two-year, accelerated, hybrid curriculum consists of 112 semester hours delivered in 16-week trimesters. The hybrid format of instruction is provided through distance education and face-to-face onsite lab immersion sessions that allow students to live anywhere in the country. The program is designed to be in full compliance with the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapist Education (CAPTE).

The program will require a broad spectrum of biological, physical, and behavioral science courses, as well as coursework in English composition to adequately prepare students for DPT graduate-level education. Prerequisite courses ensure that all students, regardless of academic major, have a basic knowledge and understanding of these foundational sciences. Additionally, standardized prerequisites provide the Admissions Committee with a consistent and equitable means to evaluate undergraduate performance and assess student readiness for DPT education. The following prerequisites are required:

*Applicants must complete Anatomy and Physiology courses within the last eight (8) years, prior to application, or demonstrate ongoing work experience that has kept this knowledge current (e.g., physical therapist assistant, athletic trainer, etc.).

Applicants will submit applications through the Physical Therapy Centralized Application System (PTCAS). In addition to the online application, applicants will be required to submit all academic transcripts, recommendation letters, proof of observation hours, and TOEFL/IELTS scores, if applicable. A DPT admissions staff member will screen all submitted applications to determine the applicants’ eligibility and calculate the initial admissions score based on the following:

Eligible applicants based on the program admissions and prerequisite coursework requirements will be invited to complete an online or video-based interview. The online interview will deliver standardized questions to the interviewees, with time allotted for reflection and recorded responses.

Once the online interview has been completed, the faculty review process will commence. The faculty review process will include a careful assessment of the applicants’ personal statements, recommendation letters, and online interview. At least two faculty reviewers will be assigned to evaluate each applicant using a standardized rubric and provide a recommendation to the admissions committee to either accept or decline acceptance into the program. The faculty review score of the applicant will be added to the initial admissions score to get the total admissions score with the highest possible score of 100.

The Admissions Committee will accept or decline each applicant based on the faculty’s recommendation and holistic evaluation of the applicant and supporting documents. Acceptance will be granted on a rolling basis. Once the maximal class size has been accepted, other applicants meeting admissions criteria and recommended for acceptance will be added to a waitlist and will be ranked based on the total admissions score. If seats become available, the Admissions Committee will use the waitlist to offer admissions to rank-ordered applicants. The program will not grant transfer credits from another program or institution. All courses within the professional didactic and clinical curriculum are required. The program will only accept advanced placement courses towards direct equivalent prerequisites if the advanced placement credit was accepted by the applicant’s undergraduate institution.

There is no ability of students to receive transfer credits in the DPT program. All students enter as a single cohort and the program is lock-step.

To qualify for graduation, candidates for a graduate degree must:

The DPT degree requirements include 112 credit hours. Most courses will be offered within the trimester format in 8-week sub sessions. All clinical education courses will be of designated lengths.
