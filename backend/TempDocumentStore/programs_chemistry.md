With a chemistry degree from Graceland, you’ll be ready to take on the world, whether you’re working in research or academia, the opportunities are endless.

Graceland students who major in chemistry gain access to a hands-on education that not only prepares them for graduate study, should they seek it, but also gives them problem-solving skills, practice with innovative thinking, research opportunities, and endless post-grad career opportunities.The chemistry degree faculty maintains the highest level of academic excellence, with every professor holding a PhD. More importantly, students have the ability to work directly with sophisticated instrumentation that students at other universities might have to wait until graduate school to encounter.The chemistry degree program has an excellent track record of preparing students for medical school, dental school, physical therapy, and many other pre-health programs. Additionally, students learn to effectively work in teams through an emphasis on a collaborative laboratory environment. Finally, Graceland’s liberal arts campus environment encourages students to attain their degree in chemistry while giving them room to pursue other passions like the arts and athletics.

In addition to the general education requirements (some are listed below with *), majors in Chemistry must complete the following 51 semester hours:

In addition to the Chemistry course requirements, the following courses are also required for majors in Chemistry:

A study of the various patterns and mechanisms of heredity, changes in the genetic material and the consequences of these genetic changes. The course will also give an introduction to cellular structures, macromolecules, and processes, including DNA replication, transcription, translation and cellular signaling. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: CHEM1330, CHEM3410, or (CHEM1410 and CHEM1450). (C or better strongly recommended).

General Chemistry I Workshop is appropriate for any student interested in developing a strong background in chemistry. It is intended to be the first university chemistry course for science majors. As such, it will be fairly rigorous and will draw upon previous experience in mathematics and science. Major areas to be covered include atomic and molecular structures, chemical bonding, stoichiometric relationships, and chemical reactions. Laboratory activities and experiments are closely related to concepts introduced in class discussions and will allow students to develop their laboratory skills. Good safety practices and experimental record keeping will be stressed. Students are expected to actively participate in class activities and discussions in addition to homework assignments, individual/group study and preparation for exams. Course is intended for biology, chemistry, and some allied health majors.  Additional fee required. Fulfills liberal learning science course. Prerequisites: MATH1280 and CHEM1310 or one year of high school chemistry.  EL06 Science, GE3D Liberal Learning-Natural Sciences.

Chemistry graduates

Chemistry is often called the ‘central science’ because of its ability to help you understand the world at molecular and atomic levels. It’s applications are endless which set students up for a wide-variety of careers in the industry. A chemistry major from Graceland University can help to prepare you for a career as a:

…and many other exciting fields.

## State of the Art Labs and Equipment

Graceland University’s Resch Science and Technology Hall provides students with opportunities to interact with and learn on equipment that, at other universities, they might not have access to until graduate school. By providing opportunities to explore their field with the best technology, Graceland students have an advantage over many other graduates in the region. The playlist below shows off many of Graceland’s excellent chemistry labs and equipment.

99% of students on the Lamoni campus receive financial aid.

As you consider college, you want a simple, easy-to-understand formula designed to ensure that the one-of-a-kind Graceland Experience is within reach for your family. Undergraduate tuition includes our uniqueTransformational Leadership major, and we offer generous financial aid and scholarships to all of our students, making Graceland as affordable, if not moreso, than most public universities.

Exclusively for students majoring in Allied Health, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science and Information Technology, and Data Science, the Resch Scholars Program rewards high-performing science students through a combination of enhanced learning opportunities and the Resch Scholars Program scholarship.The scholarship is for a variable amount up to full tuition and is renewable for up to four years.
