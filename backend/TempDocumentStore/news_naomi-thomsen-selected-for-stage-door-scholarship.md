The Graceland University Theatre Department is pleased to announce incoming freshman Naomi Thomsen as the recipient of the Stage Door Scholarship award. This is Graceland Theatre’s most prestigious scholarship and comes with a $10,000 award each year for four years.

Thomsen will begin her freshman year at Graceland this fall as a theatre major, but this will not be her first experience with the theatre department. Her high school does not have a theatre program, so, during her junior year, she reached out to Graceland Professor of Theatre Tracy Salter, MFA, to request the opportunity to gain audition experience and receive feedback. Salter immediately recognized her talent. Then, during her senior year, Salter invited Thomsen to audition again, and she was cast in the Graceland production of “Lighting the Way.”

“I’m thrilled that Naomi has chosen Graceland’s Theatre Department to be her new home away from home,” shared Salter. “Her motivation, professionalism and talent are serious assets to the program.”

This year, audiences will be able to see Thomsen in the upcoming production of “Antigone,” opening Sept. 24. As a safety precaution, all performances will move to a virtual environment this year. Continue to check Graceland’s website and the Graceland University Visual and Performing Arts Facebook page for performance dates and information on how to purchase tickets.

Upcoming Graceland Theatre Performances:“Antigone” by Sophocles (a modern adaptation translated by the ensemble) will open Oct. 1.“Men on Boats” by Jaclyn Backhaus with guest director Darrell Johnston (2010 Graceland graduate) will open Nov. 12.
