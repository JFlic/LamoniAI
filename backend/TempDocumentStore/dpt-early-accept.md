Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/dpt-early-accept/#panel263

Our pathways to early acceptance into the DPT program allow a unique way for our students at Graceland (Health and Movement Science majors) and students from external partner institutions to receive acceptance into our hybrid accelerated DPT program.  This will provide YOU the ability to have a confirmed seat in a future cohort, attend special events with our faculty, connect with our current graduate students, and quickly complete your undergraduate and graduate degree.  This will allow you to fast track your career by becoming a licensed clinician sooner, even if you begin a program that starts in August!  As a physical therapist, you can begin to provide needed care within your own community.
