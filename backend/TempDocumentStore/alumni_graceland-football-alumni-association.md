In response to alumni suggestions, Graceland established the official Graceland Football Alumni Association (GFAA) in spring 2022. This group helps to coordinate communication between the football program and alumni as well as support official football alumni events throughout the year. A lot of work has already been accomplished but we need YOUR help.

The mission of the Graceland Football Alumni Association (GFAA) is to reconnect with former Graceland players, foster a sense of community among football alumni, and organize events to gather and strengthen those connections. Through collaboration and camaraderie, we strive to build a strong and united network of Graceland football alumni that celebrates our shared experiences and contributes to the continued excellence of our beloved program.

We want to hear from you. There are no fees to join the Graceland Football Alumni Association? Want to receive updates? Provide us with your information in this form and we'll make sure that you are in the huddle.

The Graceland Football Alumni Association is working directly with the football staff to prioritize needs and we could use your help. Donations to the Graceland Football Alumni Association will go directly toward advancing the football program and improving the experience for Coach Ross and his players and coaching staff. Funds will help connect alumni to the program as well.

For more information, contact Jeff Morganvia emailor by phone at (913) 220-9209.
