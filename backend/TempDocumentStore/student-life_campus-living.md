# Housing, Dining & Campus Resources | Graceland University

Where connections are created, community is built, and friendships are grown.

When you ask someone about their time in college, the first things they mention typically aren’t the classes they took or the books they read, but the friendships they made and the adventures they had. That’s why, at Graceland, we strongly believe living on campus is an important part of your college experience. At our Lamoni campus, every floor of our residence halls is designated as a different “house,” each with its own name, symbol, colors and traditions. But there is one thing every house has in common: they’re all built around our guiding principle of inclusion — a value we take seriously and have worked hard to support since we opened our doors in 1895.

Graceland’s on-campus housing offers students a variety of options, including traditional residence halls and upperclassmen apartments.

Graybill Hall opened in 1965 and is home to five men’s houses: Agape, Cheville, Faunce, Stewart Manor and Tiona.

Gunsolley Hall first opened in 1951 and contains three men’s houses: Closson, Orion and Powell. There are also upperclassmen units available in this building.

With 130 rooms and three wings, this all-women’s residence hall built in 1960 contains more houses than any other on campus: Amici, Hanthorne, Khiyah, Paloma, Sariah and Shalom.

The women’s residence Walker Hall opened in 1929 and is the oldest residence on campus. It contains two houses — Aponivi and Solah — as well as upperclassmen units.

Built in 2011 and reserved for upperclassmen, the Small and Thomas apartments are coed on-campus buildings that offer single-gender two bed, two bath apartments for two to four people each.
