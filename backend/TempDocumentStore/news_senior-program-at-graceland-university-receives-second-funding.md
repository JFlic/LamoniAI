The Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) of Southern Iowa was awarded more than $15,000 in a second round of funding from the Iowa Commission on Volunteer Service (ICVS). RSVP of Southern Iowa concentrates activities in early childhood literacy and disaster response in Decatur and Ringgold counties, and is affiliated with Graceland University’s Youth Launch Commission programs under the leadership of Julie Neas.

“Initially, we have concentrated our efforts on enrolling sites,called stations,for volunteer activity,” said Jesse Bolinger, RSVP Director. The first stations selected include Funshine Learning Center, Lamoni; Family Resource Center, Mount Ayr; Decatur County Emergency Management; Ringgold County Emergency Management; and Graceland University.

“We are now centering our activities on actively recruiting volunteers for those sites,”  said Greg Sutherland, Graceland University’s Director of Affiliate Relations, responsible for program development with Graceland’s various partners.  “RSVP of Southern Iowa provides opportunities for retired seniors, 55 and older, to volunteer with community organizations as little as one hour a month or as much as they like. Volunteers of all skill levels and interests are welcome,” he added.

“We are working diligently to increase National Service and volunteer opportunities in Iowa as an essential part of meeting many of the social challenges facing our communities,” said ICVS Executive Director, Adam Lounsbury. “The National Service members and community volunteers supported by this funding will accomplish amazing things to strengthen Iowa communities.”
