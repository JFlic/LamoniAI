Michele Dickey-Kotz receives the 2024 IACTE “Outstanding Leader/Educator Award”.

April 25, 2024 | Jennifer Smith

Finals week is rough on students, faculty and staff—passing by the professors’ offices, you can catch snippets of them going all-in to wrap up the semester, make sure everything goes somewhat smoothly, and everyone gets through in one piece.

MeetingMichele Dickey-Kotz, EdD, in the hallways of theEdmund J. Gleazer School of Education, chances are high of witnessing her passion for education spring promptly into action. Amid her concern for the students in the finals week rush, she only briefly returns to her office, where a new trophy decorates her desk: it recognizes her tireless work and service of decades as“Outstanding Leader/Educator.”

When theIowa Association of Colleges for Teacher Educationcalled for nominations in this category of the2024 IACTE Awards, Education Department Chair Tanya Coffelt, EdD, immediately had someone in mind. She initiated and submitted a nomination for Dickey-Kotz, who was nowpresented the award on the occasion of the IACTE Spring Conference in Ankeny.

The coupling “Leader/Educator” chronicles Dickey-Kotz’s biography perfectly. It encompasses her commitment to both the classroom and the boardroom—at all intersections where education is lived, trained, delivered, developed, accredited and advanced, from the Lamoni School Board over her 33 years of dedication to Graceland University to national advocacy in academia, research and policy. Dickey-Kotz feels highly honored by the recognition, but needs to place this very special trophy aside again for now and run: her students need her right now on this stressful last stretch of the semester.

***About the award:
