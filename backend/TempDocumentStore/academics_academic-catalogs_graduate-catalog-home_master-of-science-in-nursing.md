The Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) program expands the focus of nursing, using as its foundation the basic baccalaureate nursing program. The program’s goals are directed toward educating the Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) or Adult & Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (AGACNP) or Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP). The FNP concentration focuses on preparing nurses to perform in the expanded APN role as primary care providers for individuals, groups and communities across the life-span. The AGACNP concentration focuses on preparing nurses to perform in the expanded APN role caring for adult & gerontology populations in acute and chronic care settings. The PMHNP concentration focuses on preparing nurses to perform in the expanded APN role working across the lifespan with pediatric to geriatric patients providing mental health care and substance abuse treatment in all types of healthcare settings. The student’s area of concentration incorporates a blend of theory and research with an emphasis on guided practice in relevant practice areas. Areas of concentration (FNP; AGACNP; PMHNP) are noted on the transcript.

The MSN curricula are primarily provided via the internet. Programs are designed to provide working RNs the opportunity to pursue graduate work through the completion of a combination of online cohort courses and faculty and preceptor-guided practicums in the student’s local community. All students are required to attend one focus session on Graceland’s Independence campus during the course of the program.

Postgraduate Certificate programs are available to nurses who already hold a Master of Science in Nursing degree (MSN; MN). Each specialty track presents a theoretical base specific to the selected area. The theoretical base is accompanied by clinical or practical experience which allows the student to apply the theory to specialized professional practice. All students are required to attend one focus session on Graceland’s Independence campus during the course of the program. Students admitted to a Postgraduate Certificate program are not matriculated for a graduate degree. A certificate is awarded upon completion.

To qualify for graduation, each degree candidate must have:
