Price  grew  tired  of  being  idle  and wanted  to  w ork Warden  H unter  re­ fused  to  let  him   to  do  so,  as  th e   c o u rt in  sentencing  him  had  om itted  the words  'at  hard  la b o r' The  same phrase  was  left  o u t  of  the  m ittim us. The  warden  hel  I  he  could  not  allow Price  to  labor  under the circum­ stances, so  he  w as  obliged  to  languish idly  in  his  so litary   cell.

Finally  Price  w rote  oul  a  request t o   W arden  H u n ter,  hum bly'  pleading t o   lie  allow ed  to   do  h a rd   la b o r. The request,  w ith  an  explanation  of  the circum stances, was forw arded by Warden  lln n te r  to   th e  b o ard   of  con­ tro l.

AVasliington,  M arch  30.-It is stated on  excellent  R ussian  authority  th at the  .Manchurian  convention  has  from the  lirst  been  regarded  simply'  as  a modus  vivendi. I t   w as  th is  phase~of tlic subject which Count Cassini brought  to   the  atten tio n   of  Secre­ t a r y   H ay   y e s te rd a y , and simultan­ eously  appears  to  have been im­ pressed  upon  th e   m inds  of  the  B rit­ ish  officials,  as  L ord  Laiisdovvnc  an­ nounced  to  the.  house  of  lords  th a t the  convention,  viewid  as  a  modus vivendi,  m ight  not  present  the  objec­ tions  h eretofore  held  against  it.

Tile  Uussian  authorities  at  Wash­ ington  have  all  along  construed  1 lie convention  as  a  modus  vivendi,  al­ though  Count  Cassini  has  now  made  i tliis  r a t h e r   p la in e r  to   S ecretary  Hay. It  is  explained  th a t  th e  term   modus vivendi,  as  applying  to  the  present convention, m eans th a t  abnormal con­ ditions  have  arisen  in  Manchuria,  and t h a t normal  conditions  can  best  be restored  by  m eans  of  1he  modus  vivendi. The  chief  purpose of the modus,  it  is  explained,  would  he  to provide  for  the  evacuation  of  .Man­ churia  by the  Russian troops, as Iheir  presence  there  is  jiart  of  the abnormal  condition brought alxnit by  th e  d istu rb an ces. But  with  these forces  w ith.lravv n  Ilussia  expects th a t assurances  will  bo  given  that  quiet will  be  m aintained  and  that  Ihe  for­ mal  condition  will  be,  in  fact,  re­ stored.

''·Mien th e old  s ta te of  tilings  is thus  resto red ,  it  is  th e   Russian  view th a t  th e   m odus  vivendi  will  cease  to operate  as  its purpose will have secured  the  correcting  of  abnormal conditions  brought  about  b,v  the  Chi­ nese  oul break  and  the  dispatch  of  a large Russian force 1o different points  in  Hie  province.  It  is said  th a t the  integrity'  of  China  will  be  com­ pletely'  preserved,  and  th a t  nothing in  the  n a tu re   of  a  R ussian  protecto­ rate  o r  su zerain ty   w ill  exist.

There will be some  discussion  of  the  question  of making  him  a  brigadier  general  in the  re g u la r  arm y,  but  it  was  thought th a t  fu ll  re p o rts   should  be  awaited before  acting. The  m a tte r  will  prob­ ably'  be  allow ed  to   re s t  where  it  is for  1he  present. General  Fimston is  holding  a  volunteer  commission  as brigadier  general  which  will  not  ex­ pire  u n til  Juno  30  of  th is  year,  so th a t  so  f a r   as  h o n o r  an d   em olum ents are  concerned,  his  standing  would not,  be  prejudiced  by  th e  delay'.

The  view  of  fhe  m aporitj'  nf  the cabinet  was  th a t  tho  tim e  was  not yet ripe  to   decide  w hat  course  should be  pursued  in t h e disposition of Agtiiiialdo.

With t h e expected  collapse  of  fu rth e r  op­ position  which  it  is  confidently  be­ lieved  will  follow,  the  hope  is  ex­ pressed  ihat  it  w ill  not  lie  necessary' to  m aintain  a  larg e  sta n d in g   arm y in  th e   islands  as  is  now   c o n te m p la te d .

The  disposition  of  A guinaldo,  now t h a t he  has  been  apprehended,  will be  an  in te re stin g   one  for  th e   adm in­ i s t r a t i o n to  d eterm in e. Tlic  possi­ bility'  of  his  c a p tu re   at  a n y   tim e  has alw avs  been  Kept  in  view,  and  his f u t u r e has  hoi n  a  m a lte r  of  in fo r­ mal  discussion  by  1be  officials.

Tbe  attitu d e  of  th e   g o v e rn m e n t  for a  lo n g   tim e  p a s t, had  been  one  of com parative  indifference  to   A guinal­ do's  capti.rc,  it  having  been  d e te r­ mined  Io  crush  Ihe  rebellion  w ith o u t r e g a r d to  liis  w h e re a b o u ts . His  re ­ cent  activity'  in  d irec tin g   th e   course, or  operations  against  th e  A m erican fo rc e s probably  brought  ab o u t  the r e c e n t   change  in  th is   a ttitu d e .

As  the  leader  of  an  insurrection a g a i n s t the United S ta te s govern­ ment,  Aguinaldo  m ay  be  tried   and executed,  a  lesser  ptmis-hinenf  m eted t o him   by  executive  clemency',  or com plete  am nesty  extended. While t h e question of punishm ent  rests w ith   m ilitary  a u th o ritie s ,  it   is  believ­ ed  th e   president  will  m ake  th e  m a t­ t e r one  for  d eterm in a tio n   prim arily' by  th e   a u th o ritie s   h e re .
