Tara Gallegos, MPA, ’05was hired as press secretary and spokesperson for the State of California Department of Justice’s Office of Attorney General Xavier Becerra August 2018.

Shane Adams ’99joined the Graceland staff as director of communications in November. Adams brings nearly two decades of experience in corporate America as a marketing and communications professional for brands like AMC Theatres, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Cerner. Most recently, he led a team of fundraisers, marketers and nonprofit professionals as the chief engagement officer at the PKD Foundation.

Peter Hamann ’78is a professional ceramic artist who now lives in Japan and recently realized a lifelong dream to achieve a solo show in New York. Hamann learned from Graceland faculty such as Les Wight (Graceland faculty from 1961-87), Mel Clark (Graceland faculty from 1971-84) and Dan Keegan (Graceland faculty from 1974-76 and 1980-90), and some of his work is displayed around Graceland’s Lamoni campus. Hamann’s solo exhibition, “Carving White Translucence,” took place Sept. 6-22 at the Onishi Gallery in New York City. In addition to his New York exhibition, Hamann was also recently highlighted as a featured potter inHonoho Geijutsu, a Japanese magazine featuring the pleasures of ceramics, which was also a proud achievement for him.

Rick Dickerson ’75has done the research and planning for a way to safely dispose of medications. He is the new president of Stat-Medicament-Disposal Corporation, which is addressing the pollution that comes from pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter medications that end up in soil and drinking water. Dickerson’s tireless research and planning have helped bring about the invention of a small bottle that fits inside your medicine cabinet and holds old or no-longer-needed pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter medication and vitamins, and safely destroys them in the bottle, which can then be sent off for burning to safely generate electricity. Stat-Medicament-Disposal Corporation won the 2017 FED EX New Green Business of the Year award and the 2017 Outstanding Green Business Award from SBA/SCORE. The company’s process is a win-win for everyone involved.

An exciting change is coming to the Graceland University Lamoni campus.As the university continues to emphasize the idea of a student-centered environment, it is appropriate that the Memorial Student Center (MSC), a building that is so much a part of every student’s life, should receive major renovations that will greatly impact students and their Graceland experience.
