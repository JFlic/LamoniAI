The Graceland Award of Recognition salutes those who have supported Graceland and its programs in an exceptional way.Gretchen Boozhas shared the Graceland spirit with all. In 1984, she began a 12-year tenure on the Graceland Board of Trustees where she served as vice chair and chair of the Student Affairs Committee. For decades of enthusiastic commitment, service and affection, Graceland University was proud to present its Award of Recognition to alumna extraordinaire Gretchen Booz.

The Honorary Alumni Award recognizes people who did not attend Graceland but whose record of service and commitment to the university is outstanding.Rob Kuehlhas worked hard to establish a relationship between the Graceland sociology and criminal justice programs and the Kansas City Police Department. He has donated his time as a guest lecturer and served as a resource in many ways to Graceland students interested in police work. Graceland welcomed Kuehl with the presentation of the Honorary Alumni Award last fall at homecoming.Elizabeth (Beth) Whittemorehas proven her loyalty to Graceland. She has supported the Alumni Programs Office efforts to maintain contact with university graduates by supervising arrangements for dinners in the Phoenix and Denver areas. Over 100 Graceland students have been supported by the endowed scholarship she and her husband maintain. At last fall’s homecoming, Whittemore was welcomed into the Graceland alumni family.

Alumni at least 10 years removed from graduation and still living are eligible for the Distinguished Service Award, but there is more to eligibility and consideration. Recipients must have made an outstanding contribution to community at some level, whether local or international.Dan and Beth Whittemoremet and far exceeded those requirements. Dan joined the alumni ranks in 1961, while Beth became an Honorary Alumna at homecoming last fall. They received the Distinguished Service honor together in recognition of their partnership in community service.

This is a celebration. Who wouldn’t be proud of the accomplishments of the Graceland graduates featured here? And what I find even more exciting is that this is only the beginning of what we predict for their future.
