The Ministry and Priesthood certificate and courses are designed for pre-ordination training or those interested in better understanding priesthood ministry.

Students will receive a certificate for taking three classes (Introduction to Priesthood, Introduction to Scripture, and one priesthood office specific class) through this CIMM online program. Individual classes will receive Temple School credit and CEU non-degree credit through Graceland University.

Each online class is divided into “Weeks” with one or two chapters covered each week. Students can work on their class any time from Monday-Sunday, complete their readings and assignments, and finish at their own pace as long as it is completed by Sunday at 2 p.m. (CST). All students complete the week together and engage in discussions to foster a community experience.

It takes about 1-1.5 hours a week to complete readings and assignments. The programs are designed to be flexible so there is no specific time students need to be in class – though it is expected that students will devote time each week to complete their coursework.

Costis $25 per course.

This two-year training prepares and equips experienced ministers with models and processes for group discernment facilitation.Facilitators will be prepared to accompany congregations, leadership groups, and communities who are seeking direction, asking important questions about their future, and desiring to deepen in a habit of discernment as a leadership and ministry posture.

Program Structure:In Year 1, Participants attend a 4-hour zoom session every 2 months and complete online components in-between meetings including group discussion, assigned readings, and additional assignments. In Year 2, participants will be assigned a peer-supervised practicum group as they engage a community in discernment to apply what they have learned. Mentor support will be available as needed. This training is entirely online. Participants will receive 7 CEUs total for the whole program.

Live ZOOM class meeting dates for year 1:

Participants will develop a posture of deep listening in communities and systems as a core gift and skill of discernment facilitation. This session will explore foundations of discernment in the Christian tradition, theological and scriptural grounding in discernment, and will introduce qualities and competencies of discerning leadership.

This session will cover the initial steps of preparing a community for discernment, introduction of discernment in a community with varying levels of understanding, setting appropriate expectations and timelines, creating a community covenant, the prayer for spiritual freedom, and articulating an accurate question that represents the heart of the matter for the discerning community.

Moving deeper into the discernment process, session three will address issues and practices related to the middle sections of journeying with a community in discernment. These include the substantive, holistic invitations of “gathering data” to address the question at hand, listening carefully to movements of consolation and desolation in the group, and staying with what is unfolding when the temptation to rush ahead arises! Because this is often the place where communities feel the most stuck, we will address strategies for working through possible frustration or lack of clarity. Participants will receive a variety of practices and tools including guidance for how to structure sessions to be responsive to what is emerging in the group.

This session addresses the final movements in the discernment journey including identifying emerging direction, seeking group consensus, praying for confirmation, and taking action. Participants will explore faithful facilitation as possibilities begin to emerge and how to support the group in the movements from process to praxis including invitations for a habit of discernment to guide and inform the community as it moves into the future. Focus will be given to implementation and common questions and issues in bringing a process to closure.

Having explored the discernment process in detail, participants will explore the art and skill of spiritual facilitation as it applies to discernment leadership. Discernment leadership requires structure and planning blended with flexibility and adaptability. Session 5 will discuss the prayer of spiritual freedom for discernment facilitators, navigating the various spiritual and communal movements throughout an entire process, and practical tools for organizing and guiding a group in the fluidity of a dynamic process.

Experienced discernment facilitators draw from a deep reservoir of practices and tools as preparation for responsive leadership within the movements of the discerning community. This session will orient discernment facilitators to resources, practices, and possibilities for a variety of circumstances that might arise throughout a discernment process.

The best way to learn discernment facilitation is to engage leadership of the process with a discerning community. Year 2 will offer ongoing encouragement and support for participants through peer-supervised practicum groups that will meet bi-monthly for 1 year with short, supplemental readings as needed. Mentor support will be available as needed. During this time, each participant will find a community or group to engage in a process of discernment and will come to the practicum group prepared to share what they are learning and to receive peer support, reflection, and encouragement. Each discernment process may look different, so it is not expected that participants are leading discernment for the entire year. The groups will meet to provide mutual support as facilitators find themselves in different stages and situations along the communal discernment journey.

The six courses offered through SFCP are intended to provide a cumulative curriculum that takes the participant from personal spiritual exploration to advanced topics of spiritual companionship and leadership. A formational pedagogy is critical to the participant experience and the development of each course. SFCP embraces an integrated approach of learning and forming with practice, relationship, prayer, body, mind, and spirit.

Applications for admission and enrollment will take place on thisCommunity of Christ web page. CIMM will not oversee this enrollment process but will host the certificate.

SFCP describes the process of Christian spiritual formation as a “transformative journey in the pattern of Christ for the sake of God’s shalom.” This course is both an introduction and an invitation into the study, history, practice, and integration of spiritual formation as a foundational element of Christian discipleship, ministry, and leadership. Through personal, experiential engagement and critical study and reflection, participants are encouraged to tend their own spiraling inward/outward journeys while gaining tools and resources to support others in spiritual growth and transformation.

Deep Listening is at the heart of spiritual companionship. Though we “hear” every day, deep listening is a ministry gift and skill that tends to the presence of the Spirit in “all things”, people, and circumstances. Spiritual companions learn how to listen deeply to others, self, God, and the world around them. Deep Listening is also at the heart of discernment, a vital skill of spiritual leaders.

Throughout the centuries, the mystics and spiritual leaders of the Christian tradition have emphasized that the greatest test of spiritual authenticity and integrity is transformation and compassionate action in everyday life. This course introduces participants to significant mystics (including their contributions to the Christian spiritual tradition) and movements throughout history that have shaped Christianity through the primary lens of an integrated life that embodies a rhythm of contemplation and action.

Building on foundations from Deep Listening, learners will explore what discernment looks and feels like on a communal level as both participant and facilitator. Using a primarily Ignatian model of discernment, this course offers the experience of a discernment process, attention to group dynamics in discernment, and insights from systems theory that support communal and social change as disciples seek to follow God’s call in their lives and the world.

This course will engage the “self” of the spiritual companion/leader through integration of self, calling, and vocation within one’s context. Participants will explore models of spiritual diversity, ministerial myths and narratives, and theories of spiritual and human development as part of a journey of discovering and living from “the true self in God.” The framework of the Benedictine Rule of Life will serve as a guide for everyday praxis of an integrated life and leadership style.

The culminating course of SFCP focuses on application of skills, gifts, and callings into one’s own ministry context. Attention is given to spiritual facilitation, environment, ethics, and diversity of contexts. Participants explore a variety of ways they can live into the call to spiritual companionship and leadership through examples from previous cohorts, current opportunities in Community of Christ, and discernment of their own call to ministry.

These include the substantive, holistic invitations of “gathering data” to address the question at hand, listening carefully to movements of consolation and desolation in the group, and staying with what is unfolding when the temptation to rush ahead arises! Because this is often the place where communities feel the most stuck, we will address strategies for working through possible frustration or lack of clarity. Participants will receive a variety of practices and tools including guidance for how to structure sessions to be responsive to what is emerging in the group.CIMM0140Discernment as Process: Identifying and Living the Next Faithful StepsCIMM0140Discernment as Process: Identifying and Living the Next Faithful StepsThis session addresses the final movements in the discernment journey including identifying emerging direction, seeking group consensus, praying for confirmation, and taking action.

Focus will be given to implementation and common questions and issues in bringing a process to closure.CIMM0150Facilitating Communal Discernment: An Adaptive Leadership PracticeCIMM0150Facilitating Communal Discernment: An Adaptive Leadership PracticeHaving explored the discernment process in detail, participants will explore the art and skill of spiritual facilitation as it applies to discernment leadership. Discernment leadership requires structure and planning blended with flexibility and adaptability. Session 5 will discuss the prayer of spiritual freedom for discernment facilitators, navigating the various spiritual and communal movements throughout an entire process, and practical tools for organizing and guiding a group in the fluidity of a dynamic process.CIMM0160Practices and Resources for Discernment FacilitatorsCIMM0160Practices and Resources for Discernment FacilitatorsExperienced discernment facilitators draw from a deep reservoir of practices and tools as preparation for responsive leadership within the movements of the discerning community. This session will orient discernment facilitators to resources, practices, and possibilities for a variety of circumstances that might arise throughout a discernment process.CIMM0170Practicum GroupsCIMM0170Practicum GroupsThe best way to learn discernment facilitation is to engage leadership of the process with a discerning community. Year 2 will offer ongoing encouragement and support for participants through peer-supervised practicum groups that will meet bi-monthly for 1 year with short, supplemental readings as needed. Mentor support will be available as needed. During this time, each participant will find a community or group to engage in a process of discernment and will come to the practicum group prepared to share what they are learning and to receive peer support, reflection, and encouragement. Each discernment process may look different, so it is not expected that participants are leading discernment for the entire year. The groups will meet to provide mutual support as facilitators find themselves in different stages and situations along the communal discernment journey.CIMM0110Discerning Leadership and FacilitationCIMM0120Discernment as Process: Preparing the Community and Entering the ProcessCIMM0130Discernment as Process: Staying with What is UnfoldingCIMM0140Discernment as Process: Identifying and Living the Next Faithful StepsCIMM0150Facilitating Communal Discernment: An Adaptive Leadership PracticeCIMM0160Practices and Resources for Discernment FacilitatorsCIMM0170Practicum GroupsCourse DescriptionsCIMM0110Discerning Leadership and FacilitationParticipants will develop a posture of deep listening in communities and systems as a core gift and skill of discernment facilitation.

- Spiritual Formation and Companioning Program Certificate (2024 Cohort closed)The six courses offered through SFCP are intended to provide a cumulative curriculum that takes the participant from personal spiritual exploration to advanced topics of spiritual companionship and leadership. A formational pedagogy is critical to the participant experience and the development of each course. SFCP embraces an integrated approach of learning and forming with practice, relationship, prayer, body, mind, and spirit.Applications for admission and enrollment will take place on thisCommunity of Christ web page. CIMM will not oversee this enrollment process but will host the certificate.CIMM3100 – Spiritual Formation & TransformationCIMM3200 – Deep ListeningCIMM3300 – Contemplation and Action– Mystics and Movements of the Christian TraditionCIMM3400 – Discernment in Communities and SystemsCIMM3500 – Integrated LeadershipCIMM3600 – Companioning Diverse Communities and ContextsCourses OfferedCIMM3100Spiritual Formation and TransformationCIMM3100Spiritual Formation and TransformationSFCP describes the process of Christian spiritual formation as a “transformative journey in the pattern of Christ for the sake of God’s shalom.” This course is both an introduction and an invitation into the study, history, practice, and integration of spiritual formation as a foundational element of Christian discipleship, ministry, and leadership. Through personal, experiential engagement and critical study and reflection, participants are encouraged to tend their own spiraling inward/outward journeys while gaining tools and resources to support others in spiritual growth and transformation.CIMM3200Deep ListeningCIMM3200Deep ListeningDeep Listening is at the heart of spiritual companionship. Though we “hear” every day, deep listening is a ministry gift and skill that tends to the presence of the Spirit in “all things”, people, and circumstances. Spiritual companions learn how to listen deeply to others, self, God, and the world around them. Deep Listening is also at the heart of discernment, a vital skill of spiritual leaders.CIMM3300Contemplation and Action– Mystics and Movements of the Christian TraditionCIMM3300Contemplation and Action– Mystics and Movements of the Christian TraditionThroughout the centuries, the mystics and spiritual leaders of the Christian tradition have emphasized that the greatest test of spiritual authenticity and integrity is transformation and compassionate action in everyday life. This course introduces participants to significant mystics (including their contributions to the Christian spiritual tradition) and movements throughout history that have shaped Christianity through the primary lens of an integrated life that embodies a rhythm of contemplation and action.CIMM3400Discernment in Communities and SystemsCIMM3400Discernment in Communities and SystemsBuilding on foundations from Deep Listening, learners will explore what discernment looks and feels like on a communal level as both participant and facilitator. Using a primarily Ignatian model of discernment, this course offers the experience of a discernment process, attention to group dynamics in discernment, and insights from systems theory that support communal and social change as disciples seek to follow God’s call in their lives and the world.CIMM3500Integrated LeadershipCIMM3500Integrated LeadershipThis course will engage the “self” of the spiritual companion/leader through integration of self, calling, and vocation within one’s context. Participants will explore models of spiritual diversity, ministerial myths and narratives, and theories of spiritual and human development as part of a journey of discovering and living from “the true self in God.” The framework of the Benedictine Rule of Life will serve as a guide for everyday praxis of an integrated life and leadership style.CIMM3600Companioning Diverse Communities and ContextsCIMM3600Companioning Diverse Communities and ContextsThe culminating course of SFCP focuses on application of skills, gifts, and callings into one’s own ministry context. Attention is given to spiritual facilitation, environment, ethics, and diversity of contexts. Participants explore a variety of ways they can live into the call to spiritual companionship and leadership through examples from previous cohorts, current opportunities in Community of Christ, and discernment of their own call to ministry.CIMM3100Spiritual Formation and TransformationCIMM3200Deep ListeningCIMM3300Contemplation and Action– Mystics and Movements of the Christian TraditionCIMM3400Discernment in Communities and SystemsCIMM3500Integrated LeadershipCIMM3600Companioning Diverse Communities and ContextsCourse DescriptionsCIMM3100Spiritual Formation and TransformationSFCP describes the process of Christian spiritual formation as a “transformative journey in the pattern of Christ for the sake of God’s shalom.” This course is both an introduction and an invitation into the study, history, practice, and integration of spiritual formation as a foundational element of Christian discipleship, ministry, and leadership.
