February 2, 2016

With employers looking for a variety of experiences beyond a major and degree when hiring new college graduates, joining a club as a college student can be a great way to add to your experiences and gain attention. Clubs can also simply be a way for you to interact and network with your school and peer community, having fun in the process. And there are a lot of clubs to choose from at Graceland University.

Although many existing clubs have been meeting throughout the fall semester, the Spring Clubs and Organizations Fair at Graceland – happening Thursday, Feb. 11 from 7-8:30 p.m. in the MSC Main Room – is an opportunity to reintroduce students to what is available to them, and for clubs to rejuvenate their membership for the spring semester, continuing into the 2016-17 school year.
