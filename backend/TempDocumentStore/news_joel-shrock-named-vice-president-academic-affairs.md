Shrock hired after national search.

March 29, 2022

President Patricia H. Dravesannounced that Graceland has named Joel Shrock, PhD, as its next Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty following a national search.

Dr. Shrock comes to Graceland with more than 27 years of experience in higher education, most recently as the provost at Anderson University.

President Draves said, “Dr. Shrock is a seasoned and tested leader, and I am thrilled to begin working with him as we continue to implement the next version of Graceland across the university.”

Shrock received both his bachelor’s and master’s degree in history from Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., going on to complete is PhD in U.S. History from Miami University (Ohio). Over nearly three decades, he has held leadership and academic roles at a variety of prestigious institutions, including Ball State, Miami (Ohio), and Anderson.

Dean of theCommunity of Christ SeminaryZac Harmon-McLaughlin, who served as part of the search committee said, “Dr. Shrock not only brings the academic and leadership qualities necessary for this position, he brings and innovative understanding of what is needed for Graceland to thrive in the future. Dr. Shrock embodies the mission of the University and will empower all aspects of the university to grow and ultimately transform the world.”

“Graceland University is an exciting opportunity because it is precisely the type of institution that I find attractive and that fits my skillset. Graceland is future oriented and clearly taking steps to be successful in the changing twenty-first century higher education marketplace by presenting professional programs, online programs, and graduate programs within its traditional liberal arts framework. Liberal arts schools that fail to innovate will be the ones that close their doors over the next five years. Graceland University is positioning itself for ongoing growth and success.” – Joel Shrock, PhD, new Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty

Shrock will take over Academic Affairs at Graceland beginning on July 1, 2022.
