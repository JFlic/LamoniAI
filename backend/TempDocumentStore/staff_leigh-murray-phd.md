Dr. Leigh Murray is Clinical Professor and the Director of the Physical Therapy Program at Graceland University.  She has been in PT education for over 15 years, teaching in a variety of areas including foundational sciences, musculoskeletal conditions, community health, and evidence-based practice.  She has also practiced in a variety of settings including home health, acute, and outpatient care.  Her education includes bachelor’s degrees in both Mathematics and Physical Therapy and graduate degrees in Exercise Physiology.  She has also completed a Fellowship in Educational Leadership through the American Physical Therapy Association. Dr. Murray’s research interests include educational research, exercise and the cancer survivor, and the impact of interventions in musculoskeletal conditions.

Physical Therapy was initially interesting to her because of the ability to have an impact on multiple aspects of a patient’s life through healing and movement.  An interest in moving into education was prompted by the desire to advance the profession and make a lasting impact on Physical Therapy education.  When it comes to students, her focus is on educating future clinicians who are passionate about learning and want to make a difference in both the lives of every patient they encounter as well as the Physical Therapy profession.

You can teach a student a lesson for a day; but if you can teach them to learn by creating curiosity, they will continue the learning process as long as they live -Clay Bedford
