Jolene Lynn, RN, PhD

Graceland University is pleased to announce that Jolene Lynn, RN, PhD, has been appointed dean of the School of Nursing. Lynn has served as the associate dean for graduate programs at Graceland since June 2018 and moved into her new role effective Jan. 1.

Lynn earned her Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) from Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas; her Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) from the University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC); and her Doctor of Philosophy in nursing from the University of Missouri–Saint Louis.

She has been a registered nurse for 39 years and has served as a nurse educator for 23 years. Before taking the role of associate dean at Graceland, Lynn taught for five years at Johnson County Community College and 12 years at UMKC and served as the BSN program director there for over nine years. Her practice experience includes emergency, day surgery and wound care, and her research interests include education, health disparities and student retention.

“I am excited to begin my role as the dean of the School of Nursing,” said Lynn. “It is such a pleasure to work with such qualified faculty and staff who prioritize our students.”

Nursing is a family affair in the Lynn household. Jolene, a registered nurse herself, is married to an RN, and the eldest of their three sons is also an RN.

She is passionate about students and enjoys watching them gain confidence in their abilities. In her new role, she looks forward to continuing to support Graceland faculty, as they help students to realize their dream of becoming a registered nurse, or as they expand their role as a nurse practitioner or doctor of nursing practice.

Vice President for Academic Affairs Jill Rhea had this to say about the announcement. “I’m so pleased that Jolene has agreed to lead the school of nursing as the new dean. She brings so much experience that will serve her and us well in this role, including her existing leadership experience in our school of nursing. But she also brings broad experiences throughout her career in the field of nursing prior to coming to Graceland that will continue to be an advantage to our program. Her curricular expertise and program development experience will be excellent assets as Graceland continues to provide many options for a top-tier nursing education.”
