In response to a growing need for accessible mental health care, Graceland University proudly launched theUwilltelehealth platformthis year. Already, 60 students across both campuses have registered, tapping into its flexible and comprehensive support system.Uwill’sappeal lies in its adaptability — offering remote access for distance learners in Graceland’s online programs while complementing traditional in-person counseling services for on-campus students. The platform’s capability to offer counseling that aligns with students’ specific personal preferences is particularly valued, reflecting Graceland’s commitment to personalized care. This flexibility and ease of access are crucial steps toward ensuring that effective mental health support is readily available for every student.

The expansion of these services has been enhanced by the generosity of our alumni. Among them, Mary Stowell ’72 Fry, PhD, LCPC, RPT-S and Robert “Bob” Fry, DDS, ’70 stand out for their deep commitment to the welfare of our students. Moved by global trends in youth mental health challenges, Mary, leveraging her two decades of experience as a counselor educator, has contributed significantly to Graceland’s mental health resources. Her pledge supports not only the broadening of services but also ensures that these services effectively meet the varied and specific needs of our diverse student population. Mary shares why she’s driven to support mental health efforts at Graceland, speaking from both personal insight and strong conviction:

“According to the World Health Organization, depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents, and suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds. As a counselor educator in a university setting for over 20 years, I feel compelled to help address those needs at my alma mater. I realize that for most college students, this is their first experience living away from their families. It is my hope that Graceland will address these emotional needs through an increase in student counseling services.”

Supporting Mary’s vision is alumna Lisa Prosser-Dodds, PhD, ’81, the University’s lead mental health specialist, whose expertise has been instrumental in shaping effective, empathetic care on campus. Under her guidance, counseling services have grown not only in scope but also in depth, offering everything from one-on-one counseling to group therapy sessions.

Feedback from the student body underscores the positive impact of these enhanced services. Many students have expressed a newfound sense of being supported, highlighting how this has improved their overall well-being and academic performance. Complementing these services, the‘Mental Health Matters’ podcast, hosted by Dr. Lisa and students Cyril “Ivan” Joseph ’26, and Jordan Meyer ’25, serves as an additional resource, discussing important mental health topics and offering insights that enhance students’ understanding and management of their mental health.

TUNE IN TO THE PODCASTDuring the school year, new episodes upload weekly on Monday nights, or you can listen to the podcast nightly at 8 p.m. on KBUZ Radio:gracelandbuzz.org/kbuzplayer

Graceland University remains committed to supporting the mental health of our students, and continues to refine and enhance services, ensuring every student benefits from resources meeting their unique needs.

Through the dedication of our alumni, the expertise of our mental health professionals, and innovative initiatives likeUwill, Graceland creates an environment where mental wellness is a fundamental aspect of our educational approach. Looking ahead, we remain focused on empowering students with the tools they need for academic and personal success, affirming our commitment to an education that truly supports every aspect of student life.
