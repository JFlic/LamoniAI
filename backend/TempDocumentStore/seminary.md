Change the world by learning Graceland’s responsible and transformational theological interpretation.

The Community of Christ Seminary at Graceland University is shaped by a strong dedication to creating a place of belonging for all people, not just those who look, think and live the way we do. Backed by a solid foundation grounded in Christianity, we believe that faith should be inclusive and welcoming — and we teach all of our courses and concentrations through the lens of this perspective.

The Community of Christ Seminary’s mission is to educate and prepare — through prayerful scholarship, teaching, service and mentoring — faithful, creative and discerning leaders for ministries in congregations, church and the world.

“Seek ye diligently, and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning even by study and also by faith.” — Doctrine and Covenants, 85:36

The Community of Christ Seminary is committed to:

Designed for bi-vocational and professional ministers, Graceland’s Master of Arts in Religion is a 34 semester hour graduate program with three different concentrations in Christian Theology, Spiritual Leadership, Peace and Justice. All three of these concentrations provide a unique blend of religious theory and practical studies with a strong focus on biblical studies, Christian history and theology, leadership, peace and justice.

Graceland’s Master of Arts in Peace and Social Transformation is a 34 semester hour graduate program that aims to develop personal and moral integrity for students, which is essential in the public work of peace and justice. By pairing foundational theological and scriptural courses with formational, contextual, and practical academic studies, students can deepen their experience and understanding of peace, social change, and justice work

A collaborative partnership with Graceland University, Community of Christ, and others housed and hosted in Graceland University’s Community of Christ Seminary.

CIMM offers non-credit bearing continuing education units (CEU’s) that focus on priesthood development, leadership development, and theological education. These CEU’s do not lead to a degree.
