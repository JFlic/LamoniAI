President Draves reflects on #Grateful4Graceland Day of Giving

March 28, 2022

#Grateful4Graceland Day of Givingis one of my favorite days of the year.

Not only do we raise money for the Graceland Fund, which directly impacts students through three areas of focus – scholarships and student support, leadership and learning, innovation and infrastructure – but even more enjoyable is watching Gracelanders come together around the globe to share all the reasons why they are grateful for this amazing institution.

And come together you did to raise $257,300 forGraceland Day of Giving! With the generous matching pool, this means that each of you helped us raise well over HALF A MILLION DOLLARS for our students, providing even more young people with opportunities to live out the Graceland Experience on our campuses.

When VP for Student LifeDave Schaal and I talked about what makes Graceland special, my immediate response was “people, people, people.” The people that make up this institution, from the faculty and staff to the students and alumni – you all inspire me and make me so thankful to be a part of this institution. You have welcomed me, embraced me as a part of the community, and helped me grow as we share our vision for the Graceland of the future.

At this pivotal moment n Graceland’s history, your generosity helps ensure we can continue to support the community that makes Graceland such a special place for so many.

Thank you to all of you who helped us achieve this goal through your generosity of both money and spirit. I am grateful for you.

If you missed out on any of the interviews shared on #Grateful4Graceland Day of Giving, I encourage you tohear directly from our students and staffabout why your ongoing financial support makes a difference. From ournursing programto ourinternational studentsto ourathletes, all of our students benefit from your generosity during our annual Day of Giving. The world needs Graceland graduates now more than ever—thank you for ensuring our current students have the support they need to succeed.
