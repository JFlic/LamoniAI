Dr. Anders’ passion is learning and teaching economic theory, and he has studied and taught a variety of economic courses throughout his teaching career. A goal he has in every course is for students to develop as analytical and critical thinkers. Analytical and critical thinking are at the heart of a liberal arts education. The academic discipline of economics lends itself well for developing the tools and skills to be an effective analytical and critical thinker. Just as important is effective communications. Dr. Anders recognizes the importance of communications in the professional life of an economist; therefore, he emphasizes the importance of strong verbal and written communications, especially in the capstone course he teaches in economics.  As an entrepreneur, Dr. Anders owns and operates a small business he uses to illustrate various economic principles.

In addition to his extensive teaching career, Dr. Anders’ administrative experience at Graceland University includes fourteen years as Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty, one year as acting president, seven years as dean for the C. H. Sandage School of Business, and two years as interim dean for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.  Dr. Anders serves on multiple boards and committees and currently chairs two boards for other organizations. He has twice been selected to teach an economics course as a Fulbright Scholar for the International Summer University at the University of Prishtina, Kosovo. Dr. Anders is one of only three professors in the 123-year history of Graceland University to be granted distinguished professor status by its board of trustees.
