## I Coincidence  and  a Recon­ sideration.

, ' · BY  J.  P.  COUGHLIN. (Copyright,  190t,  by  Dally  Story  Pub.  Co.) Paul  W estover  had  every  reason  to ^'./'congratulate  him self  upon  the  success §TV.'  -ofhis  new  book. The  public  received I," ' it  wltb.  gratifying  approval,  and  the 1 critics  b cstcved  vpon  it  well-tempered 'Commendation Being a first-born, |v . ,i however,  the  critics  felt  bound  to  patronize  both  it  and  its  w riter  in  their customary  paternal  fashion,  aud  while lauding  its  other excellent qualities ' '  they  pointed  out  and  dwelt  upon  the ? un-realistlc improbabilities of the ' ''jiiain  incidents  in  which Mr. Westv,.  .'over's  heroine  was  centered.

■ That  this  should  be  so  was only ^.-natural: Mr. Westover  was  ridicupiously  young  to  know  anything  ot  the '^/'im penetrable  fem inine,  and  yet  he  had ■ /   dared  to  m ake  "G ertrude  W arner'  the .. «lory  of  a  woman's  life,  a  story  of [' Ittany  strange  phases,  and  of  curious j though  incorrect,  said  the  reviewers, ' '-Insights  into  the  workings  of  a  young v'  ; ^girl's  mind.

Westover  was  almost  on  the  point ·\? o t arcepting  the  critic's  dictum. Ho ./ivji& d  fancied  th a t  his  portrayal  of  Gerf}ij|rutle  W arner  was  well  and  clearly  imA  f^iagiued,  but  after  all  what  could  he,  a ^Wttmchelor  and  impressionable,  know  of men. The  reviewers  must  be  right, rtrude  W arner  was  falsely  drawn.

But  there  was  at  least  one  person ho  did  not  think  with  tho  reviewers, he  newly-fledged  author  received  in liis mail  from  his  publishers  a  long 'letter  th a t  was  tru ly   startling  to  his [pelf  possession. Its  full  length  may ot  be  given  here  but  its  gist  is  conined  In  a  couple  of  paragraphs.

'You  arc  evidently  very  intimately cqualnted  with  the  story  of  the  dark­ est  passages  in  my  life,  but  surely  it was unnecessary tliat the details should  be  made  public  so  faithfully . .and so  callously. 1  would  like  to  think h a t   your  story  was  purely  a  eolncldence  and  evolved  entirely  from  your own  imagination,  but  the  details  up  to tlie  denouement,  in  every particular, ure  so  carefully  true  to  fact  that  I have  no  other  course  than  to  believe th a t  some  unw orthy  recipient  of  my confidence  has  In  an  idle  moment  betrayed  my  unhappy  history.

'Doubtless  you  will admit that I have  at  least  the  right  of  asking  an explanation,  the  more  especially,  see­ ing  th a t  you  have  even  given  to  your novel  a  title  so  like  the  name  borne by  her  who  nsks  it.

## ' GERMYN  WARREN'

Westover finished  the  reading of this letter with  a  rue expression. He whistled  softly  to  himself  and  looked blankly  at  the  wall  in  an  endeavor  to collect  his  thoughts and adequately consider  the  situation presented to him. In  a  m om ent  the  humorous  aspect of  the  affair  dawned upon  him and he  laughed  quizzically.

'One  of  the  delights  of  novel-writing,"  he  m urm ured  aloud;  'is  to  run across  some  hysterical woman  who finds  your  book  a  m irror  of  her  past.

A  startling  letter.

I f   I   am   expected  to  reply  to  all  such my  hands  will  be  full. Yet  what  a splendid  answer  to  the  critics.

His  better  and more sympathetic nature,  however,  for  as  yet  he  was  not experienced  enough  to  be  callous,  as­ serted  itself,  and  he  penned  a duly consolatory letter to Miss Germyn .Warren.

A  week  later  Paul  Westover  had  an encounter  that  caused  him  consider­ able  embarrassment.

'Mr.  Westover,  our  youngest  nov­ elist,  Miss  W arren.'

The  serenity  and  self-contalnedness of  the  frail  p retty   girl  before  him  was in   striking  contrast  to  tho blushing stammering awkwardness of the young author. The  clear  blue  eyes,  however, $&>T>ut  him  at  liis  ease  quickly  and  he te /io u n d himself  lost  in  amazement  at p.-how  different  the  girl  before  him  was iV^-om  the  morbid  woman  with  a  past

musically  in  upon his semi-absorption.; 'but  there  are  some  things  In  your book  I  would  like  to  talk  to  you  afiout. May  I?'

Westover  found  himself  In  a  quiet corner  of  the  drawing  room,  anticipat­ ing  a  quarter  of  an  hour's  stern  cross-i examination  at  the hands  of  Miss W ar­ ren. Somehow  the  ordeal  did  not  seem to  bo  so  terrible  as  it would havo seemed  two  days  previously.

Sitting  in  his  arm chair  that  n ig h t Paul  Westover  meditatively  addressed the  smoke-clouds  from  his  cigar.

'She  is  wonderfully  pretty-she  has exquisitely  sweet  eyes  and what a charming  talker,  even  though  we  did talk  only  of  the  serious  things  of  life. She  is  indeed  an  ideal  heroine-in  real life.'

Westover  pulled  himself  up  abruptly and laughed a  quick,  nervous  laugh.

'Come,  this  won't  do-contem plating such  a  thing  already  Is  m aking  haste too  quickly-but  that's  absurd. Why before  I  know  it  I'll  be  thinking  ot marriage And  marriage  would  be  the ruin  of  a  young  writer. I t would-'

matrimony until  finally  he  went  to  bed convinced  if  not  exactly  pleased.

His  encounter with Miss  Germyn W'arren,  and  the  train  of  thought  it prompted  may  have  had  something  to do  with  Mr.  W estovcr's  departure  for the  west,  but  the  literary  journals  a n ­ nounced  his  trip  as  taken  for  the  p u r­ pose  of  acquiring  local  color  for  a new  novel.

During  the  two  years  th a t  followed Paul  Westover's  literary  output served to  increase  considerably  his  growing reputation. 1-Ie  returned  to  New  Y ork and  prepared  to  settle  down  com fort­ ably  to  meet  the  demands  made  upon him  by  his  publishers. The  novel,  to prepare  which  he  left  New  York,  was a pronounced  success, and though his  old  lriends,  the  critics, did  not appear  to  notice  it,  Paul  himself  w as conscious  of  a  certain  resemblance  in type  between  his  new  heroine  and  his old,  th a t  Is  to  say  Miss  Germyn  W ar­ ren. He  tried  to  reason  th a t  this  new heroine  was  simply  but  a develop­ ment  of  the  Gertrude  W arner  of  his first  book,  and  thus  he  tried  to  dis­ pel  his  lingering  fears  th at  he  had drawn  upon  Miss Warren,  his ac­ quaintance  of  a  single  evening.

Again  in  his  career  Mr.  Paul  W estover  had  an  encounter  which  caused him  to  become  as  discomposed and nervous  as  he  had  been  at  his  first meeting  with  the  coincidental  heroine of  his  flrst  book.

I t   was  a t  a  lite ra ry   reception.

"Permit  me,  Miss  W arren,  to  Intro­ duce  to  you  Mr.  Paul  W estover-you have,  no  doubt  read  his  clever  books.'

'Yes,  everything  Mr.  W estover  has written,'  said  Germyn  W arren,  as  she extended  her  hand  to  Taul,  who  stood bowing  and  blushing  lilco  a  schoolboy. Then  with  a  smile  of  gentle  m ischief playing  around  her  lips  as  they  were left  alone  she  continued: And  I  can­ not  think  th a t  Mr.  W estover  has  fo r­ gotten  me  since  some  of  my  friends would  have  it  I  am  portrayed  rath er faithfully  in  your  most  recent novel and  even  in  several  of  your  magazine stories.'

Westover  was  plainly  surprised a t this  frank  challenge,  and  for  the  sec­ ond  time  in  his  life  he  found  him self keenly  observing  the  heroine  of his fiction. He  noticed  the  same  clear, blue  eyes  and  wondered  at  how  close­ ly  he  had  remembered  them  all  this time. He  found  himself  on  terms  of old  acquaintanceship  with  this  m ag­ netic  little  girl,  for  she  was  only  a girl. For  a  moment  until  the  pre­ sumption  of  the  thing  struck  him  he felt  a  tinge  of  regret  being  taken  aw ay from New York  for  so  long.  How  th a t evening's  reception  passed  he never knew. He  had  a  very  definite  notion that  he  had  spent  by  far  the  greater part  of  the  evening  in  the  society  of Miss  Warren.

That  night  in  the  seculslon  of  his chambers,  over  his  cigar,  he  came  not unwillingly  to  the  conclusion  th a t  a ft­ er  all:

'What is  to  be  is  to  be,  and  it  seem s to  me  that  the  fates  have  ordained th a t  I  should  creato  a  heroine  for  m y­ self. Either  I  am  in  love  or  am  d rift­ ing  relentlessly  towards  th a t happy state  of  mind. Of  course  m arriage  is the  to-be-expected  outcome  of love, and  for  a  young  man  struggling  for fame  and  fortune  a  sympathetic  wife is  a  great  helper,  a  constant  incent­ ive-'  and  thus  he  proceeded  to  adapt his  views  to  the  altered  state  of  hi? circumstances.

## 'Who  Is  THU  Tennyson?"

When  Tennyson  was nearing GO years  of  age,  and  his  fame  m ight  fa ir­ ly  be  assumed  to  be  world-wide,  E d ­ ward  Moxon,  the  publisher,  decided  to approach  Gusfave  Dore  and  commis­ sion  him  to  illustrate  the  "Idylls  of the  King.'

(Copyright,  1901,  by  Louis  IClopseh.  N.  T.) Washington,  April  14.-In  this  dls* course  Dr.  Talmage  sets  forth  religion as  an  exhilaration  and  urges  all  people to  try  its  uplifting  power;  text,  Pro­ verbs  lii,  17,  'H er ways  are ways  of pleasantness."

You  have  all  Jieard  of  God's  only  be­ gotten  Son.  Have  you  heard  ot  God's daughter? She  was  born  III  heaven. She  came  down  over  the  hills  of  our world. She  had  queenly  step. On  her brow  was  celestial  radiance.  Her  voice was  music. Her  nam e  is  Religion,  My text  introduces  her. 'Her  ways  are ways  of pleasantness,  and  all  her paths are  peace.' But  w hat  is  religion?  The fact  is  th a t  theological  study  has  had a  different  effect  upon  me  from  the  ef­ fect  sometimes  produced. Every  year I  tear  out  another  leaf  from   my  the­ ology  until  I  have  only  three  or  four leaves left-in  other words,  a  very brief  and  plain  statem ent  ot  Christian belief.

An aged  C hristian  m inister said'When  I  was  a  young  man  I  knew  ev­ erything. When  I  got  to  be  35  years of  age,  in  my  creed  I  had  only  a  hun­ dred  doctrlncs  of  religion. When  I got to  be  40  years  of  age,  I  had  only  60 doctrines  of  religion. When  I  got  to be  60  years  of  age,  I  had  only  ten  doc­ trines  of  religion,  and  now  I  am  dying a t   75  years  of  age,  and  th ere  is  only one thing  I  know and  th a t  Is  that Christ  Jesus  came  into  the  world  to save sinners.'  And so I  have  no­ ticed  In  the  study  of  God's  word  and in  my  contemplation  of  the  character of  God  and  of  the  eternal  world  that It  Is  necessary  for  me  to  drop  this  part of  my  belief  and  th a t  p art  of  my  be­ lief  as  being  non-essential,  while I cling  to the  one  great  doctrine that man  is  a  sinner  and  C hrist  is  his Al­ mighty and  Divine  Savior.

Now, I take  these three  or four leaves  of  my  theology,  and  I  find  that in  the  first  place  and  dom inant  above all  others  Is  the  sunshine  of  religion. When  I  go  Into  a  room,  I  have  a  pas­ sion  for  throw ing  open  all  the  shut­ ters. That  is  w hat  I  w ant  to  do  this morning. We  are  apt  to  throw  so much  of  the  sepulchral  into  our  relig­ ion  and  to  close  th e  shutters  and  to pull  down  tho  blinds  th a t  it  is only through  here  and  there  a  crevice  that the  light  stream s. The  religion  of  the Lord  Jesus  Christ  is  a  religion  ot  joy indescribable  and  unutterable. Wher­ ever  I  can  find  a   bell  I  m ean  to  ring It.

If  there  are  any  in  this  house  this morning  who  are  disposed  to  hold  on to  their melancholy  and  gloom, let them  now  depart  this  service  before the  fairest  and  b rig h test  and  the  most radiant  being of  all the universe comes  in. God's  Son  has  left the  world but  God's  daughter  is  here! Give  her room. Hall  princess  ot  heaven!  Hall, daughter  of  the  Lord  God  Almighty! Come  in aud  make  this  house  thy throneroom.

In  setting  forth  this  idea  the  domi­ nant  theory  of  religion  is  one  of  sun­ shine. I  hardly  know  where  to  begin, for  there  are  so  m any  thoughts  that rush  upon  my  soul. A  m other  saw  her little  child  seated  on  the  floor  in  the sunshine  and  w ith a  spoon  in her hand.  She  said,  ' My  darling,  what are you  doing  there?'  'Oh,'  replied  the child,  'I  am  getting  a  spoonful  ot  this sunshine." Would  God  that  today I might  present you  with a  gleaming chalice of  tills  glorious, everlasting gospel  sunshine!

## Sunshine  o f  C hristian ity.

First  of  all,  I  find  a  great  desl  of sunshine  in  Christian  society. I do not  know  ot  anything  more  dololul than  the  companionship  of  the mere funmakers  of  the  world-the  Thomas Hoods,  the  Charles  Lambs,  the  Charles Mathewses of the  world-the men whose  entire  business  it  is  to  make sport.  They  make  others  laugh,  but  it you  will  examine  their  autobiography or  biography,  you  will  find  that  down in  their  soul  there  was  a  terrific  dis­ quietude. Laughter  is  no  sign  of  hap­ piness. The  maniac  laughs. The  hy­ ena  laughs. The  loon  among  the Adlrondacks laughs. The drunkard, dashing  his  decanter against  the wall, laughs.

There  is  a  terrib le  reaction  from all sinful  amusement and  sinful merri­ ment. Such  men are  cross  the next day.  They  snap  a t  you  on  exchange  or they pass  you,  n o t  recognizing you. Long  ago  I  quit  m ere  worldly  society for  the  reason  It  w as  so  dull,  so  Inane and  so  stupid. My  nature  is  voracious of  joy. I  m ust  h ave  it.

I  always  walk  on  the  sunny  side  of the  street,  and  for  th a t  reason  I  have crossed  over  into  C hristian  society.  I like  their  mode  of  repartee  better. I like  their  style  of  am usem ent better. They  live  longer. Christian  people,  I sometimes  notice,  live  on  when  by  all natural  law  they  ought  to  have  died. I  have  known  persons  who  have  con­ tinued  in  their  existence  w hen  the  doc­ tor  said  they  ou g h t  to  have  been  dead ten  years. Every  day  of  their  exist­ ence  was a  defiance  of  the  laws  of anatomy  and  physiology,  but  they  had this  supernatural  vivacity  of  the  gos­ pel  in  their  soul,  and  th a t  kept  them alive.

f

## The  Quofitlon  o f  S e lf  D en ial.

I  know  there  is  a  g rea t  deal  of  talk about the  self-denials,of  the  Christian. I have to tell you th a t  w here  the Chris­ tian  has  one  self  denial  the  man  of the world  has  a  thousand'self  denials.  Tha Christian  is. not  com manded  to  surjjendtr  anythlngTUUkt: isVwortti  keeping.

But  what does  a  man  deny himself who  denies  himself  the  religion of Christ? He  denies  himself  pardon  for sin,  he  denies  himself  peace  of con­ science,  he  denies  himself  the  joy  of the  Holy  Ghost,  he  denies  himself a comfortable  death pillow,  he denies himself  tho  glories  of  heaven. Do  not ta lk   to  me  about  the  self  denials  of the  Christian life. Where  there  Is  one in  the  Christian  life  there  aro  a  thou­ sand  in  the  life  of  the  world. 'Her ways  are  ways  of  pleasantness.'

Again,  I  find  a great  deal  of religious sunshine  in  Christian  and  divine  ex­ planation. To  a  great  many  people life  Is  an  inexplicable  tangle. Things turn*  out  differently from  w hat was supposed. Thero  Is  a  useless  woman In  perfect  health. There  is  an  Indus­ trious  and  consecrated  woman  a  com­ plete  Invalid. Explain  that. Thero  Is a  bad  man,  with  |30,000 of  lncomc. There  is  a  good  man  with  $800  of  in­ come.  Why is  that?  There  is  a  foe  of society  who lives  on,  doing  all the damage ho  can,  to  75  years  of  age,  and here  is  a  Christian  father,  faithful  in every  department  of  life,  at  35  years of  age  taken  away  by  death,  his  fam­ ily  left  helpless. Explain that. Oh, there  Is  no  sentence  th a t  oftener  drops from  your  lips  than  this: 'I  cannot understand  It. I cannot understand it."

Well,  now  religion  comes  In  just  at th a t  point with  its  illum iuation  and  its explanation. There  is  a  business  man who  has  lost  his  entire  fortune. The week  before  he  lost  Ills  fortune  there were  20  carriages  that  stopped  at  the door  of  his  mansion. The  week  after he  lost  his  fortune  all  the  carriages you  could  count  on  one  finger. The week  before  financial n trouble began pooplo  all  took  off  their  hats  to  him  as he  passed  down  tlie  street. The  week his financial prospects were  under  dis­ cussion  people  just  touched  their  hats without anywise bending the rim.  The week  that  he  was  pronounced insol­ vent  people  just  jolted  their  heads  as they  passed,  not  tipping  their  hats  at all,  and  the  week  the  sheriff  sold  him out  all  his  friends  were  looking  in  the store  windows as  they  w ent  down  past him.

## A ll  Is   fo r   th e  H est.

There  are  hundreds  of  peoplo ' who are  walking  day  by  day  in  the  sublime satisfaction  th at  all  is  for  the  best,  all things  working  together  for  good  for their  soul. How  a  man  can  get  along through  this  life  without  the  explana­ tion  is  to  me  a  mystery. What! Is th a t  child  gone  forever? Are you  nev­ er  to  get  it  back? Is  your  property gone  forever?  Is your soul  to  be bruis­ ed  and  to  be  tried  forever? Have  you no  explanation,  no  Christian  explana­ tion,  and  yet not  a  maniac? But when you  have  the  religion  of  Jesus  Christ in  your  soul  it  explains  everything  so far  as  it  is  best  for  you  to  understand. You  look  off  in  life,  and  your  soul  is full  of  thanksgiving  to  God  that  you are  so  much  better  off  than  you  lhight be. A  man  passed  down  the  street without  any  shoes  and  said: 'I  have no  shoes. Isn't  it  a  hardship  th at  I have  no shoes? Other people have shoes. No  shoes,  no  shoes!'  until  he saw  a  man  who  had  no  feet. Then  he learned  a  lesson. You  ought  to  thank God  for what he  does Instead of grumbling  for  what  he  does  not. God arranges  all  the  weather  in  this  world -the  spiritual weather, the moral weather,  as  well  as  the  n atu ral  weath­ er. 'What  kind  of  weather  will  It  be today?'  said someone  to  a  farmer.  The farmer  replied,  'It  will  be  such  weath­ er  as  I  like." 'What  do  you  me?n  by th a t? "   asked  the  other. 'Well,'  said the  farmer,  'it  will  be  such  weather as  pleases  the  Lord,  and  w hat  pleases the  Lord  pleases  me.'

Oh,  the  sunshine,  the  sunshine of Christian  explanation! Here  is  some one  bending  over  the  grave of the dead. What  is  going  to  be  the  conso­ lation? The  flowers  you  strew  upon the  tomb? Oh,  no. The  services  read a t   th e  grave? Oh,  no. The  chief  con­ solation  on  that  grave  is  w hat  falls from  the throne  of God. Sunshine, glorious'* sunshine! Resurrection  sun­ shine!

## A  Place  for  Study.

And  geology! What  a  place  that will  be  to  study geology  when  the world la  being  picked to  pieces as easily  as  a  school  girl  in  botanical  les­ sons  pulls the  leaf  from  tfi'e  corolla! What  a  place  to  study  architecture, amid  the  thrones  and  the  palaces  and the cathedrals-St. Mark's and St. Paul's  rookeries  in  comparison.

Sometimes  you  wish  you  could  make the  tour  of  the  whole  earth, going around  as  others  have  gone,  but  you have  not  the  time,  you  have  not  the means. You  will  make  the  tour  yet, during  one  musical  pause  in  the  eter­ nal  anthem.  I say  these things  for the comfort of those  people who are abridged  in  their  opportunities,  those people  to  whom  life  is  humdrum, who toil  and  work  and  toil  and  work, and aspire  after  knowledge,  but  have  no tim e  to  get  it  and  say,  'If  I  had  the opportunities  which  other  people have, how  I  would  fill  my  mind  and  soul with  grand  thoughts!' Be  not  dls couraged,  my  friends. You  are  going to  the  university  yet. Death  will  only matriculate  you  into  the  royal  college of the universe.

What  a  sublime  thing  it  was  that Dr.  Thornwell  of  South  Carolina  ut­ tered  in  his  last  dying  moments! As he  looked  up  he  said,  'I t opens;  it  ex­ pands,  it  expands!" Or  as  Mr.  Toplady,  the  author  of  'Rock  of  Ages,' in  his  last  m oment  or  during  his  last hours  looked  up  and  said,  as  though he saw. something supernatural, 'Light!'  and then  as he came  on near­ er  the  d y in g 'moment,  his  countenance more  luminous,-he  cried',  'L ight!"  and a t the  very, moment'  of  his  departure lifted  both  hands,  something  supernat­ ural, in  his  count«»ince,  as  he  cried.

'L ig h t!" Only  another  name  for  sun­ shine.

## The  Releetlal  Profession.

And  then  I  stand  at  the  gate  of  the celestial  city  to  see the  processions come  out,  and  I  see  a  long  procession of  little   children,  with  their  arm s  full of  flowers,  and  then  I  see  a  procession of  kings  and  priests  moving  in  celes­ tia l  p ag eantry-a  long  procession,  but no  black  tasseled  vehicle,  no  m ourn­ ing  group,  and  I  say: 'How  strang9 i t is! Where  is your Greenwood? Where  is  your  Laurel  Hill? Where  is your  W estm inster  abbey?' And  they shall  cry,  'There  are  no  graves  here.' And  then  listen  for  the  tolling  of  th e old  belfries  of  heaven,  the  old  belfries of  eternity. I  listen  to  hear  them   toll for  th e   dead,  but  they  toll  n o t  for  the dead. They  only  strike  up  a  silvery chime,  tower  to  tower,  east  gate  to, west  gate,  as  they  ring  out,  'They shall  hunger  no  more,  neither  th irst any  more,  neither  shall  the  sun  lig h t on  th em   nor  any  heat,  for  th e  Lam b which  is  In  the  midst  of  the  throne shall  lead  them  to  llvng  fountains  of water,  and  God  shall  wipe  aw ay  all tears  from   their  eyes.'

Oh,  unglove  your  hand,  and  give  it to  m e  in   congratulation  on  th a t scene! I  feel  as  if  I  could  shout. I  w ill  s h o u t Dear  Lord,  forgive  me  th a t I ever complained  about anything.  If all this is  before  us,  who  cares  for  anything but  God and heaven and eternal brotherhood? Take  the  crape  off  tho doorbell. Your  loved  ones  are  only away  for  their  health  in  a  land  am ­ brosial. Come,  Lowell  Mason;  come, Isaac  W atts. Give  us  your  best  hym n about  joy  celestial.

What  is  the  use  of  postponing  our heaven  any  longer?  Let  it  begin  now, and  whosoever  hath  a  harp,  let  her th ru m   It,  and  whosoever  hath  a  tru m ­ pet,  le t  him  blow  It,  and  whosoever hath  an  organ,  let  him  give  us  a   full diapason. They  crowd  down  the  air, spirits  blessed,  moving  in  calvacade  of triu m p h . Their  chariot  wheels  w hirl in  th e   S abbath  sunlight. They  come! Halt,  arm ies  of  God! Halt,  until  we are ready to join  the  battalion  of pleasures  that  never  die!

Oh,  m y  friends,  it  would  take  a  ser­ mon  as  long as  eternity  to  tell  the  joys th a t  a re   com ing  to  us. I  Just  se t  open the  sunshiny  door. Come  in,  all  ye disciples  of  the  world  who  have  found the  w orld  a  mockery. Come  in,  all  ye disciples  of  the  dance,  and  see the bounding  feet  of  this  heavenly  glad­ ness. Come  in,  yo  disciples  of  w orld­ ly am usem ent, and see  the  stage  w here kings  are the actors and  burning word8 the  footlights  and  thrones  the  spectac­ ular. Arise,  ye  dead  in  sin,  for  th is is  th e   m orning  of  resurrection. The joys  of  heaven  submerge  our  soul. I pull  out  the  trumpet  stop. In Thy presence  there  is  a  fullness  of  joy;  a t Thy rig h t hand there are pleasures forevermore.

Blest  are  the  saints  beloved  of  God; Washed  are  their robes in Jesus' blood.

Brighter  than  angels,  lo,  they  shine. Their  glories  splendid  and  sublim e!

## My  soul  anticipates  the  day,

Would stretch her wing and soar away; To  aid  the  song,  the  palm  to  bear, And  bow,  the  chief  of  sinners,  there.

Oh,  the  sunshine,  the  glorious  sun­ shine!

## P lio * ,o * r a p liln * Jew elry.

Photographing  jewelry  as  a means of  its   protection is  likely  to   become popular now that the picture  of a valu­ able  diam ond  brooch  led  to  its  recog­ nition  and  recovery. But  it  is  doubt­ ful  if  th e re   is  one  woman  am ong  ten who  owns costly  jewelry  th a t ever thought  of  taking  this  precaution.  One photographer who takes  m any  pic­ tures  of  women of wealth  in New  Y ork said th e other day that few of  them  ever had themselves  photographed  w earing th e ir   jew elry,  since  It  had  become  th e style  to  wear  less  jewelry  th an   form ­ erly. He looked at random  over  half a  dozen  portraits  made  recently,  and there  was  scarcely  on  any  of th e ir originals jewelry that  am ounted to more  than  a  few  hundred  dollars In value. Yet  the  majority  of  these  wo­ men  own  jewels  worth  thousands of dollars. In  England  the  custom  of wearing  jewelry in  photographs is much  more prevalent than it  is  in New York. Pictures  of  English  women  of wealth  and position usually  display the  en tire   contents of  theiv.  jewelry boxes,  and {heir  tiaras, stom achers and  necklaces  are  frequently  conspicu­ ous  enough  to  be  serviceable as a means  of identification were they stolen,  although  thieves  rarely dare to  keep  such things  intact for  even the  briefest  time. American women owning  valuable  jewelry  are  not  likely to  possess any photographs of it,  unless they  -were  especially  taken. And  th a t precaution  has  so  far  been  observed in  few  cases.-New  York  Sun.

## A  Judge an  Inventor.

Judge  W altner  of  W apakoneta,  O., has  distinguished  himself  by  inventing a  h y d ra u lic   disappearing  safe  operated on  the principle  of the  disappearing gun. The  safe,  controlled  by  hydrau­ lic  power,  is  lowered  into  a  fifteen-foot well  a t  night. When it touches  bottom clockwork  mechanism  starts  it  tow ard the  Jtop,  which  is  reached  about  the timte' it is  wanted  for  business  the  n ex t morning. Judge Waltner  does not t h i n k   ro b b ers could  accomplish any­ th in g   by tunneling  to  the  safe. The judge  has  applied  for  a  patent, but what  if  the  machinery  should  be  de­ ranged  some  night  and  the  safe  left a t   t h e   b o tto m   of  the  well?

Here  is  th e   la te s t  s to r y   o f  Ju d g e Henry  12.  Ilow land,  one  of  th e   m ost popular  after-dinner  speakers  of New York: 'There  was  a   iittle   boy  wha was  badly  puzzled  over  th e   th e o ry   oi evolution.  He w ent to  liis m other and asked: 'Mamma, am  I descended fronj a  m onkey?' '1  don't   know ,'  she  am swered;  'I   never  m e t  any  of  you* father's peoiJle.' '

Herbert  A.  Giles  gives  th e  follow­ ing  example  of  Chinese  hum or  in  hiq 'History  of  Chinese  L ite ra tu re ' : 'A man  who  had  been condemned  to wear,  a  wooden  collar  w as  seen  by some  of  liis  friends. 'Wliat  have  you been  doing:,'  they  aslced  him ,  'to  de* serve th is ? ' 'Oh,  n o th in g ,'  h e  rep lied; 'X only picked up an old piece of rope.* 'And  you  are  to  be  punished  th u s  se­ verely,'  th e y   said,  'fo r  m e re ly   picking up  an  end  of  rope?' 'Well,'  answ ered the man,  'the  fact is  th a t  th e re  w as  a bullock  tied   to  the  o th e r  end.' '

In his biography of Phillips BrooKs, Alexander  V.  G.  Allen  of  Cambridge tells  of  a  clergym an  w ho  w as  going; abroad,  and  talked in je s t  of  bringing back  a  new   religion  w ith   him . 'You might have some trouble in getting it through th e  custom  house,'  some  one remarked. 'No,' observed  Bishop Brooks:  'we  may  tak e  it  fo r  g ran ted that  a  new   religion  w ould  have  no duties  attached." Another  person, for  the  sake,  no  doubt,  of  argum ent, once  drew   atten tio n   to   th e   fa c t  th a t some men, calling them selves atheists, seemed to lead moral  lives,  and Brooks prom ptly disposed of it. 'They have  to,'  said  he;  ' th e y   have  no  God to  forgive  them   if  th e y   don't.'

Little  Tommy  Lincoln looked  up  into  the  red   w a rrio r's  face and  said: 'Don't  kill  me. Take  me a prisoner.'  The Indian smiled.  Ju st then  a  rifle  cracked. Indian  and  boy tumbled off the  horse,  th e   Indian dead, w ith  a  bullet  in  h is  b rain .  Tom­ my  Lincoln's  father  had  come  to  the rescue. j
