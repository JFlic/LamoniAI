# Masters in Data Science and Analytics | Graceland University

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/programs/data-science-and-analytics/#top

Our data science graduate program is designed to prepare students for careers in many disciplines and backgrounds by relying on the use of real data to address current problems and issues.

The Master of Science (MS) in Data Science and Analytics will prepare students to transform data into information so that insight is gained for addressing real-world problems.Our data science graduate program requirements consist of a core set of courses in statistical analysis, basic programming, machine learning, data extraction and transformation, and methods of data science. Students will also complete an Emphasis in Machine Learning and complete a capstone project.Data science and analytics is an area in which many disciplines and backgrounds can and do participate. Graceland's program takes a very practical and applied learning approach to skills development. The program relies on the use of real data sets to address challenging and current problems and issues. Data science involves using data to predict future outcomes, whereas data analytics focuses on analyzing past data to make decisions in the present. Both are crucial for various fields such as government, private industry, finances, healthcare, tech, or transportation.

The MS degree requirements include 21 semester hours in the Core Requirements, 9 semester hours in an Emphasis, and 3 semester hours in a Capstone experience. The total hours required to attain the MS degree is 33 semester hours. Each course will be offered in 8 week segments on a schedule to be determined.

Core Requirements (21 semester hours) and Capstone Experience (3 semester hours)

Machine Learning Emphasis(9 semester hours chosen from the following)

An introduction to the methods of data science through a combination of computational exploration, visualization, and theory. Students will learn scientific computing basics, topics in numerical linear algebra, mathematical probability, statistics, and social and political issues raised by data science. Prerequisites: Prior courses in statistics, calculus and basic programming.

Exploratory data analysis is introduced along with fundamental considerations for data analysis on real data sets. Classical models and techniques for classification are included. Methods of data visualization are introduced. Pre- or Corequisite: DSCI5300

Students will learn skills of data acquisition, methods, of data cleaning, imputing data, data storage and other important issues required to producing usable data sets. Code books, data standards, and markdown files will be introduced as well as the concept of the data lake. Pre- or Corequisite: DSCI5300.

This course covers the fundamentals of probability theory and statistical inference used in data science. Students will be introduction to statistical modeling including linear regression models, and generalized linear regression models. Pre- or Corequisite: DSCI5300.

An introduction to computer systems, architecture and programming for data science. Coverage includes data structures, algorithms, analysis of algorithms, algorithmic complexity, programming using test-driven design, use of debuggers and profilers, code organization, and version control. Additional topics include data science web applications, SQL, and distributed computing. Pre- or Corequisite: DSCI5300.

A modern introduction to inferential methods for regression analysis and statistical learning, with an emphasis on application in practical settings in the context of learning relationships from observed data. Topics will include application of linear regression, general linear models, variable selection and dimension reduction, and approaches to nonlinear regression. Extensions to other data structures such as longitudinal data and the fundamentals of causal inference will also be introduced and applied. Pre- or Corequisite: DSCI5340.

The course covers the most often used methods of the machine learning in a practical context.
