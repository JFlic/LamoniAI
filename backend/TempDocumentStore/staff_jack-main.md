Higdon Administration Building, Rm# 5

Jack graduated from Graceland in 2024 with a major in Interdisciplinary Studies with focuses in computer science, graphic design, and English. He was deeply involved in university life as a member of the Esports team, Academic Student Council(ASC), the Campus Organization for Social Activities(COSA), and House President of Tiona House. Through his time as a member of the Esports team, Main learned the value of focus, dedication and teamwork by working with his fellow athletes to compete at the collegiate level. And through his role as Tiona House President, Jack learned the value of communication, honesty, hard work, and integrity by helping his fellow housemates thrive at Graceland. He accomplished all of this and more while working on his own video game called “The Tenebris Chronicles”, which follows the player as he gathers a team to traverse a unique, original galaxy to find six magical grimoire.

After graduating from Graceland, Main worked for the McClain restaurant group as an intern. His role including created and marketing various events hosted by the McClain’s on the Independence Square to help strengthen the local community. Jack now gives back to Graceland by applying everything he learned during his time at the University to help students become the best versions of themselves as an Admissions Advisor.

Jack has a deep love for Graceland. Many members of his family have graduated from the University, including his mother, sister and grandparents. But more than that, he believes whole heartedly that Graceland is a place that welcomes everyone, and turns them into wise, kind, and loyal leaders who can change the world thanks to its transformative, supportive, and inclusive community.

My grandma told me once to 'be kind and cheerful to one and all.' And I've lived by that quote my entire life - always treating others with kindness and respect. But Graceland helped me understand what those words truly mean. Here, I learned what it was to really be a part of a community, and to always treat others with all the empathy I can muster. Which has in turn led me to become a better communicator, friend, and leader after graduating. Graceland is a master at helping you grow to become the best version of yourself. And I want to share that with as many people as possible by helping them enroll.
