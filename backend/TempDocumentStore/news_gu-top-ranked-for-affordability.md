August 29, 2013

Washington Monthlymagazine’s “2013 Best Bang for the Buck” ratings system has ranked Graceland University as one of the most affordable private schools in the country.

The “Best Bang for the Buck” rating is designed to help students from families making $50,000 a year or less choose higher education institutions that offer marketable degrees at affordable prices. The rating system factored in the percentage of students who received Pell Grants, the school’s overall graduation rate, and the cost of the school after applying need-based aid. Graceland ranked high in both the All Schools listing (No. 59 out of 359) and in a Master’s Universities listing (No. 23 out of 152). In the general ranking, Graceland was second only to Iowa State University (ranked No. 57) among Iowa colleges and universities. Other Iowa colleges and universities in the All Schools ranking include Grinnell College (No. 74), the University of Northern Iowa (No. 95), Maharishi University of Management (No. 166), Clark University (No. 167), Simpson College (No. 197), St. Ambrose University (No. 206), and Northwestern College (No. 248).
