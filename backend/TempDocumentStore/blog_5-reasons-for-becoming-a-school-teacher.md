- Teachers Are Never BoredSince every day is different, teachers are never bored. While lesson plans might be prepared ahead of time, there are always situations that arise, so flexibility is key. A teacher might need to help a student one on one, or reteach a concept differently because students aren’t comprehending the lesson. There could be an unexpected incident that requires time to handle, a visitor may show up or there could be a fire drill. Teachers are constantly making decisions about how to handle the unexpected things that come up. The ability to adjust is just one of the aspects of the job that sets apart truly outstanding teachers.
- Teachers Earn A Good LivingEveryone knows teaching is not the profession for those who want to get rich quick, but starting salaries for teachers are comparable to those of many other professions. According to figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, public-school teachers’ salaries are roughly 11% more than the average professional worker. Teaching also offers opportunities for career development and better pay over time. Although teachers don’t make as much money as many business professionals, they can earn a salary that allows them to live comfortably.
- Teachers Have BenefitsBenefits such as pension plans and health insurance are not always available to many working people, but many teachers can have their own health insurance covered by their district, and then have the opportunity to pay to add members of their family. Many professions have pension funds that an employee can pay in to, and in most instances, employers will match some portion of the contributions. Teachers typically have the same options available to them, but they are contributing to a teacher retirement system instead of typical investment accounts, which often yield higher earning amounts. Most school districts contribute as well, and often match a higher amount then is traditional in a business setting.
- Teachers Have Flexibility In Their SchedulesStudents generally spend seven hours a day in school, and teacher’s hours typically require before and after school time. While some occupations require employees to be at the office for overtime hours, teachers can often do some of their grading and lesson planning at home. This allows a teacher to still have family time, get together with friends and have hobbies. There are after school and evening events that teachers are required to attend, such as faculty meetings, department meetings, Back to School Night, Parent-Teacher Conferences, reading or math nights, concerts, etc., but these are scheduled in advance so teachers are better able to balance them with home life.
- Teachers Can Have Job SecurityRequirements to be a teacher vary by state, and districts have the ability to establish tenure policies, but in many cases, when you establish your reputation as a good teacher and fulfill the requirements for tenure, you can have some job security. Special Education teachers are required to obtain specialized certifications in order to work with students who have difficulty learning, so job security may be more significant for them. There will always be a need for teachers, so job opportunities can be found anywhere in the country. In addition, in contrast to many employers, schools rarely undergo major downsizing.
