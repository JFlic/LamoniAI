Lucas Co.

But during the late spring and summer of 1846, the ox-drawn wagons of Mormon pioneers had begun to pass through the future town site by the hundreds after Brigham Young directed those following him to Utah to abandon a more southerly trail through Wayne County and follow what now is called the Mormon Trace. Elder Freeman Nickerson’s family party, forced by weather, worn out equipment and exhausted livestock to find refuge along the point’s heavily wooded eastern flank during the winter of 1846-47, became its first long-term residents; Nickerson himself, the first known non-native to die here.

The point continued to be a stopping place for Mormons during the next two years, a wooded and well-watered place to rest before continuing to Garden Grove or Mount Pisgah. William S. “Buck” Townsend, Kentucky-born adventurer and pioneer entrepreneur, and his family were the point’s first permanent settlers, arriving perhaps during 1848 and buying a Mormon pre-emption land claim. The Trace remained the most popular route across southern Iowa for pioneers, California-bound ’49ers and others through the 1850s.

The first challenge Lucas County faced, once the town site was selected, was figuring out how to purchase it. The land was not yet officially on the market and the commissioners had no money. The county solved the first problem by making a pre-emption claim to the site. The money issue was resolved by Robinson, who purchased a military land warrant that entitled the bearer to claim 160 acres. Two years later, Robinson used the warrant to obtained title to the town site in his own name and transferred it to the county.

Chariton was platted soon after it was located and the first lots, mostly around the square, sold on Nov. 5, 1849. Almost immediately, Nelson Wescott built the first store — a cabin at the intersection of what now are Braden Avenue and North Main Street. The original plat was resurveyed and corrected during 1851.

Derby was platted in 1872. Today, one of the only “businesses” in town still in operation is the post office, and only on a part-time basis. in 1958, Derby Cafe opened in the old building next to the post office building. Gusta Flack operated the cafe until she retired at 86 years old in 2000. She now rests peacefully in the Derby Cemetery after passing at age 100.

The Burlington and Missouri River Railroad Company established a station at Lucas in 1866, named after Lucas County and Robert Lucas. A plat for the town was filed on May 9, 1868 and the town was incorporated on March 18, 1887. The town grew slowly until coal was discovered in the area.

In 1864, William Nelson built the first house in what is now Russell.  In 1865, the first permanent survey was made for the railroad.  The ground was cleared and the tracks were laid through 1865-66 and completed in 1867.  The railroad company then purchased 30 acres of land from William Nelson on which the town of Russell was to be built. On October 8, 1867, the original town of Russell was platted by H. S. Russell and contained 209 lots.  This was the official beginning of Russell.

By 1914 Mr. Williamson had added to the original 80 acres of land purchased by his father and included in his holdings was the area upon which the town of Williamson was located. He made plans for the town after the Des Moines-Kansas City branch of the Rock Island railroad was built through his land and donated to the railroad ground for its depot and yards. Due to the start of the mining industry in the vicinity of Williamson the town attracted residents from various parts of the country and enjoyed a rapid growth.

Mr. Williamson was appointed in 1922 to serve as postmaster for the town, which he founded and held the post for 11 years. He remained until his death senior member of the Williamson & Son Lumber Co. at Williamson, which he organized when the town was started.

Clarke Co.

Like most rural Iowa towns, Murray started as a railroad town when the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad built its line through the area in 1868. The first people to come through Murray, outside of the Native Americans who inhabited the area, were the Mormons. The deep ruts cut by the wagon wheels of these early travelers are still visible today through parts of the town of Murray, which was initially the location of the Harold Burnett farm.

Early transportation was by stage with the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad coming to Clarke County in 1868. In 1881 a north-south narrow gauge railroad began running from Des Moines, through Osceola, to Missouri. It was abandoned many years ago. Today, Osceola is situated at the junctions of Interstate 35, Highway 34, and the Burlington railroad.

In 1880, the town of Weldon was born when the Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad was built through the territory. The Weldon Depot, in operation from 1881-1946, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

The iron horse was slow in reaching southern Iowa. For nearly twenty years after its first settlement, Clarke County communicated with the outside world only by stage lines. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad came into Clarke County in 1867. It was decided to steer its course through the natural valley south of the town of Ottawa. In days of slow transportation, this inconvenience of a mile was a hard blow for the merchants. Most of the merchants and residents immediately moved to Woodburn. In July of that year, the railroad came as far as what is now Woodburn, at the fork of the Brush and Gooseberry creeks. It is said that the little town that sprang up around the railroad station was called Woodburn because of the great piles of wood that were placed along the track near the station to fuel the engines. This was the only station in Jackson Township. The first train arrived in Osceola from the east on January 15, 1868.

Union Co.

Afton was founded in 1854 by Edward Temple. The town’s name was chosen by Temple’s wife, who is said to have named it afterFlow Gently, Sweet Afton, a popular melody of the time based on a poem about the River Afton in Scotland.

Afton was soon appointed as the county seat by a local commission. Later in 1857, when the official vote was held, the fast-growing township of Highland contended for the honor of hosting the county seat. According to one recorded account, Afton narrowly won the election only after a local town leader forged a letter purportedly from the president of the Burlington and Missouri Rail Road (B&MRR) Company indicating that the new train tracks would pass through Afton instead of Highland.

Arispe was established in 1887 when the Chicago, St. Paul and Minneapolis Railroad Company built its track through Union County. The town remained little more than a store or two and several homes for much of the next decade. In 1897, an additional 65 acres were purchased and added to the town. During the next three years, a hardware store, general store, drug store, Methodist church and bank were all constructed, along with a number of new homes.

By 1902, telephone lines had reached Arispe, and later in the year, work began on a new grain elevator. The first mayor, DW Stevenson, was elected in 1904. The following year, a modern four-room schoolhouse was constructed. Arispe’s population would reach its peak of 156 during the 1920 census.

The Burlington and Missouri Railroad established the City of Creston in 1868 as a survey site. The name ‘Creston’ was chosen because the site was located on the highest point – the crest – of the railroad line between the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Creston was eventually chosen as the division point for the new railroad, and the growing city quickly became home to additional workers, machine shops, and an enormous roundhouse with stalls for 60 engines in storage awaiting repairs or their next trip down the tracks. In fact, in the early 20th century, the Creston roundhouse was the largest American engine house west of Chicago.

Creston was officially incorporated in 1871. With the growth of the railroad station came a growth in the city’s population and standing in the county. A vote was held in 1890 to move the county seat from Afton, and the measure passed due in some part to the City of Creston having already built a brand new county courthouse in anticipation of the verdict.

The city of Cromwell was founded in 1869 and was the preliminary choice for the division point on the new Burlington & Missouri River Railroad (B&MRR) line. Selection as the division point would mean rapid growth for the community as the railroad built a roundhouse, machine shops and other facilities. Unfortunately, after further examination, B&MRR surveyors decided that the nearby land would require too much work to make a division point at Cromwell practical. Instead, Creston was chosen, and its population would grow to over 7,000 while Cromwell reached just over 200 at its peak at the turn of the century.

Kent is a former city in Union County, Iowa, United States. The population was 52 at the 2000 census. In 2003, after years of rural flight, the tiny city was disincorporated, ending its status as an officially recognized community. As of the 2010 census, it is recognized as a census-designated place with a population of 61.

Lorimor was founded in 1887 when farmer J.S. Lorimor was approached by agents of the Chicago Great Western (CGW) Railroad and asked to sell a portion of his land to be used to construct the new tracks. Instead of selling, Mr. Lorimor offered to donate the land for the right-of-way if the new station and town would be located on other portions of his farm. The deal was struck, and over the next five years, the new city quickly grew to a population of almost 400 and would eventually boast nearly 700 at its peak shortly around 1910.

After a series of fires destroyed much of the town in the early 1890s, a city ordinance was passed requiring new buildings in the business district be constructed of brick or similar fire-resistant materials. Several of these brick structures are still in use today.

The town of Thayer was surveyed in 1867 as a possible stop on the new Chicago, Burlington and Quincy (CBQ) Railroad. A year later in 1868, the city was platted, and the first home was built. By the turn of the century, Thayer had grown to a population of almost 400.

Named by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Garden Grove was the first permanent encampment or way station on the Iowa Mormon Trail. Established in 1846, it was utilized by the Saints until 1852. Being more than a campsite, it allowed the traveling Saints to rest, make repairs, and have shelter and minimal provisions. Fences and structures were built and crops were planted to be harvested by those who came later.

Grand River, Iowa, was established in 1881 when E.C. Perkins laid the town out for the purpose of laying out towns along the route of the Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad and the post office branch was established, after the first school was erected in 1876 and before the city was incorporated in 1900.

Lamoni was founded as a church colony in 1879 when it was platted as a town. The earliest settlers had come approximately 30 years before the laying out of the town. The first was a group that came from 1834 to 1840 who thought they were settling Missouri. In those days, there was intense feeling and marked division over the slavery issue. The group miscalculated by a few miles on the boundary line and found they could not hold slaves in Iowa Territory. Lamoni’s real beginnings, however, do not spring from this group.

The town of LeRoy was established in 1880 and named after early settler Leroy Buffman. The LeRoy Town Company was organized July 1880 and land was set aside in the northeast corner of the plat for a school to be know as Independent School District of LeRoy. The following season, 1881, a large one-room schoolhouse was built by Flanagan & Barkhuff, carpenters from Garden Grove. The schoolhouse was also used for religious services till November 1890 when the first Presbyterian Church was dedicated.

Early pioneer settlers to this area found plenty of water and lots of timber along the creeks. Leon, settled in 1853 and incorporated in 1858 as a shipping point when the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad laid track through the area, is the present Decatur County seat and is situated about two miles northeast of the geographical center of the county. Thomas H. East had built a house on the town site before the town was laid out. Judge C. S. Thompson built the first house after the location of the town. Clark, Winn & Co. built the first business house, and I. N. Clark sold the first goods in September 1853.

Pleasanton is situated on the divide between Grand River and Little River, on the south line of the county in Hamilton Township. An addition to the village is situated in Missouri.

The town was laid out in the spring of 1854 by Daniel Bartholow. The first school was taught in 1857 by M. J. S. Warmer. This schoolhouse, a log building, also served as a meeting house, erected in the early days of the town. The logs (1915) are still in use in the framework of a barn erected by H. A. Cowles.

Van Wert was established in 1881 after the Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska extended its line to that point. Before that time, it had been a small settlement first called Florence, then Prairie City, then Prairieville. Before the railroad reached this settlement, there had been a store there owned by John Gammill and a mill, which had attracted much attention because its owner attempted to operate it by wind. Though in 1881, it was like others in the county – a steam engine mill. Now Gammill’s store had competition as W. E. Stone, D. Tharp and Mark Sanger went into business in newly built stores. As time passed, more businessmen came to Van Wert. There was a bank, a newspaper, an opera house (which was in use until it burned in 1915), and other stores and shops. Van Wert was a railroad center for when the Narrow Gauge was built. It was a station on that line as well as on the Humeston and Shenandoah, which took over the Missouri-Iowa and Nebraska at this point.

Ringgold Co.

Beaconsfield was established in 1881 when the Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad came through the northern portion of Ringgold County. The Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad later became the CB&Q Railroad which later abandoned the line in late December of 1945.

There is a legend in which a man came through the countryside who could do blacksmith work. He broke a wheel and stopped to fix it. While he was working on it, a farmer came along who needed some work and suggested that the man start a blacksmith shop. He did, and a town sprang up around his shop. The blacksmith was of English origins, and he named the town growing around his shop “Beacon” in honor of Lord BEACON of England. The word “field” was added. There is a Beaconsfield in Canada, but no other town in the United States named “Beaconsfield.”

When the Chicago Great Western Railroad came through the western portion of Ringgold County in 1885, the town of Benton was founded as a rail station. A news clipping proclaimed, “The name of our new town and depot is Benton. It is located in Rice Township, on uncle S[amuel] Irvin’s land joining the Nicholson farm on the south.” Before the arrival of the railroad, Benton was known as the post office Bloomington. The Chicago Great Western route coming through Benton was known as the Maple Leaf Route.

Benton was located in two townships with Main Street following the boundary line of Rice and Benton Townships. In 1910, the county supervisors created a new township out of the large independent school district which was named Waubonsie Township.

Clearfield was platted in 1881 when the Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad was being built through that territory. The town was incorporated in 1882.

Clearfield is the only school in Iowa that is known to have a Civil War monument on its grounds. Despite not even being incorporated until the 1880s, this town, 16 miles from the Missouri, border managed to get its own. But the town’s population peaked in 1900 — a statistic that is not uncommon in Iowa. Today, it has a population of only 363, down from 698 at the turn of the previous century.

When the Leon, Mount Ayr and Southwestern Railroad extended to Grant City, Missouri, in Sept. of 1880, the town of Borneo was laid out. There had been some settlement at the site before. Mr. Mike Rush sold his store and post office in Delphi (present-day Maloy) around the year 1879 and moved east to the town of Borneo along the new railroad. Frank Jordan built the first residence and established his blacksmith shop. Franklin Seaton arrived in the new town and became a partner of Mike Rush with his mercantile store. In 1885, Mr. Seaton succeeded Mr. Rush as postmaster. Other businesses soon followed: stores owned and operated by J. W. Bowman, M. H. Evans, I. M. Long; the first elevator owned and operated by I. M. Long; Harrington’s blacksmith shop; T. Bolt’s wagon shop; and D. Sclappia’s hotel. W. H. Palmer assumed a position as the station agent. The town of Borneo was renamed Delphos on Nov. 18, 1880. Delphos quickly gained a reputation as being one of the cleanest and most circumspect towns in Ringgold County.

In 1880, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy (CB&Q) Railroad passed through the town of Goshen. In 1885, the Chicago Great Western Railroad (CGW) came through Knowlton. At a point approximately two miles from Goshen and Knowlton, the tracks crossed diagonally with the CB&Q passing on a creaky bridge and the CGW on firm ground. This crossing became a hub of activity with passengers changing trains as needed. Ultimately, the people felt that there was a need to provide lodging and meals for the passengers at this cross. Thus, the town of Diagonal was officially incorporated in 1888 at this crossing.

Anticipating the arrival of the railroad across the state of Iowa, Mr. Cochran and Mr. LeFever built a general store in the town of Wirt in 1881. Upon the failure of the store six months later, it was sold. In March 1882, the Humeston & Shenandoah Railroad established Wirt as one of their stations. With the establishment of Wirt, the post office was moved from three miles northeast at Union Hill in 1884. To avoid confusion in the mail delivery between Wirt and Van Wert of Decatur County, Iowa, the town’s name was changed to Ellston in 1895.

To meet the needs of area farmers and stock raisers, Ellston had a stockyards and scales located near the rails. J. E. Evans, Ellston’s first minister, helped erect a Methodist Church.

With the arrival of Leon, Mount Ayr and Southwestern Railroad late in 1879, the town of Kellerton was established and officially incorporated in Dec. 1881. Kellerton was the first Ringgold County town to be platted by a railroad. The town was named in honor of Judge Isaac W. Keller (1828-1923), one of the leading Ringgold County citizens. Judge Keller emigrated from Noble County, Ohio, settling in present-day Jefferson Township on June 10, 1855.

The site of Kellerton was purchased from Samuel and John Tedrow, high level ground, where on a clear day, one could see Mount Ayr to the west and Leon to the east. Three and a half miles to the north was an old buffalo wallow about 20 feet deep. When the wallow filled with water, many pioneers used it as a swimming hole.

Although the town of Maloy was originally named Delphi, many of the locals referred to the town as Foxtown due to the large red fox painted on a storefront in the town’s early days. The town was situated in a dense, natural grove on the eastern banks of the Platte River. There was a post office, which was established in Nov. 1880. In 1875, the town was designated as a rail town when the Chicago Great Western Railroad came through the western portion of Ringgold County in 1885. The town, renamed Maloy, was platted in 1887. Maloy’s early businesses included a tavern, general store, hardware, lumberyard, livery stable, hotel, a dray service and a blacksmith shop.

In 1851, commissioners chosen by the State Legislature located the first site of Ringgold County’s seat four miles south of the center of the county and named it “Urbana”. In January of 1855, commissioners were chosen to re-locate the county seat of Ringgold County. Their selected site was a farm which belonged to Edward A. Temple, who sold the land to the county.

Mount Ayr was named “Mount” because it was the highest elevation between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and “Ayr” after the birthplace of the poet Robert Burns, Ayr, Scotland. Barton and Laura Dunning were the first settlers in the Mount Ayr vicinity, arriving in 1855 when the town was a small rural hamlet.

A treaty entered between the Pottawattamies and the United States government on July 15, 1830, relinquished the tribe’s right to the western portion of what would become Ringgold County. The remainder of the land was ceded to the United States in 1846. When the survey of the county was completed in 1849, the land was opened to settlement.

Shannon City was established in 1887 and laid out June 5, 1888 on both sides of the Ringgold/Union county line with the business section located mainly on the south side in Ringgold County, the post office in Union County. It had three stores, a post office, a blacksmith shop, a boarding house and was proud of their brass band and drums corps. Between 1889 and 1891 a fire destroyed most of the businesses located in Ringgold County. Dr. Loomis led the rebuilding of the town on the north side in Union County. (Mount Ayr Record-News, Mount Ayr, Ringgold County, Iowa, Thursday, March 12, 2015, Page 8)

Quentin and Rita Anderson enjoyed the pristine beauty of an area located near Ellston. Not only did the Andersons enjoy the land, but they felt it should be preserved for the enjoyment of others. The Andersons researched several other lake developments in other states thinking that the 1,500 acre tract of timbered hillsides would be an ideal spot for a recreational facility.

In 1969, applications were made to the State of Iowa; the land was surveyed and cleared. Anderson, who had experience in conservation work and owned construction equipment, began to realize his dream.

Several settlers in Ringgold County who wanted mail services met around the year of 1867 in the home of William “Tingley” Cornwall with the purpose of establishing a post office at his home. They agreed to take turns carrying the mail from the nearest point (Afton in Union County) to connect with the stage line. The name “Silver Street” was submitted to the U.S. Post Office Department, but it was rejected because there was another post office by the same name in Iowa at the time. It was suggested that Cornwall send in his own name, which he did. Consequently, the name “Tingley” was approved. Tingley Cornwall was appointed as the post master.

When the Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad – in partnership with the Burlington and Wabash Companies – came through the northern part of Ringgold County in 1881, the railroad purchased the land for the future site of Tingley from area farmers. Tingley was incorporated in 1883 with 211 residents and named indirectly for Tingley Cornwall.

Wayne Co.

Allerton was platted by the Rock Island Railroad when it came through the area in 1870. It became a legal town in 1874 and had a peak population of 1,600 in 1913.[5]Allerton and Corydon were rivals for the Wayne County seat. Several times, during the early establishment of the two towns, county records were moved back and forth, sometimes illegally, before Corydon was declared the county seat.

Allerton used to have its own school system and then merged with Lineville and Clio to form ACL Community School. In 1966, Allerton voted to leave ACL and merge with Cambria-Corydon to form Wayne Community School. Classes were held for different grades at the Allerton school until the school house was deemed deficient in the latter part of the 20th century. Classes are now held in Corydon.

Clio was part of Lineville-Clio Community Schools until the district voted to disband in 2010. Lineville-Clio merged into Wayne on July 1, 2011. It was known as ACL Community for its namesake town names of Allerton, Clio, Lineville until 1966 when Allerton voted to join Cambria-Corydon to form Wayne Community Schools.

Corydon acquired its name in a rather unorthodox way. The men who selected the site and laid out the plats could not agree on a name. Springfield and Anthony were both suggested but met with disapproval, so a game of poker was suggested. The winner would then name the town. Judge Seth Anderson won the game and named the town after his old hometown of Corydon, Indiana. There remain only three Corydons in all of this country: Iowa, Indiana and Kentucky.

The town of Corydon was laid out and platted in 1851. It was late that same year that it was designated as the county seat town. There had been a struggle between the citizens of Allerton and Corydon to be the county seat. It was that same year that Lewis Miles brought his family from Ohio. He purchased quite a bit of land for $1.25/acre. Much of the town of Corydon is built on that land, and many abstracts carry the Miles name. The log cabin in Dotts Park (near the Prairie Trails Museum) was built in replica of the cabin for the Lewis Miles family.

Founded in 1872, the town was named by railroad official S.W. Mallory for Ava Humeston who owned the land on which the town was platted. The land was purchased by a couple of gentlemen named Perkins and Manchester, and H.B. Scott was the agent in charge of procuring the 240 acres. A post office was established in 1872, and the town was incorporated in 1881. The population in 1880 was 645 compared to current day at 494.

Lineville has been called the oldest town in Wayne County but was not noted on early maps or in the 1850 state line survey. The small town most likely attracted settlers from a nearby short-lived community called Grand River after the state line dispute was settled. Lineville was platted in 1858.

Because part of the town is in Missouri and part in Iowa, it was named Lineville. The town square sits on the Iowa-Missouri border with the business on the south side of the square in South Lineville, Missouri. When Wayne County was dry, liquor by the drink could be purchased at the bars on the Missouri side of the square.

Postal service was established in the Wayne County, Iowa, community of Promise City in August 1856. When service was discontinued in the nearby towns of Clio and Millerton in 2006, Promise City became the smallest city in the county with an active post office location. The 2000 census indicated 105 residents, down from a peak population of 274 in 1910.

Seymour is, like Allerton, indebted for its existence to the railroad, which was built through Wayne County in 1870. It was laid out by J. C. Fox, William Wade, Hiram Evans and H. S. Rogers, who gave every alternate lot to the railroad company in order to get their good will, advertising, etc. Several names were suggested for the new town. Three-quarters of a mile west of the town site is a tall cottonwood tree, now inconspicuous from a second growth of timber, which has been a landmark for the farmers ever since the first settlement of the county. The “lone tree” was referred to in giving directions to travelers and known to all within 30 or 40 miles. It was the point of rendezvous for many a wolf hunt and picnic party. Many therefore, favored the name of “Lone Tree” for the town, and though this failed of selection, its memory is perpetuated in the name of the only newspaper published here—the Lone Tree Press.

- CharitonBut during the late spring and summer of 1846, the ox-drawn wagons of Mormon pioneers had begun to pass through the future town site by the hundreds after Brigham Young directed those following him to Utah to abandon a more southerly trail through Wayne County and follow what now is called the Mormon Trace. Elder Freeman Nickerson’s family party, forced by weather, worn out equipment and exhausted livestock to find refuge along the point’s heavily wooded eastern flank during the winter of 1846-47, became its first long-term residents; Nickerson himself, the first known non-native to die here.The point continued to be a stopping place for Mormons during the next two years, a wooded and well-watered place to rest before continuing to Garden Grove or Mount Pisgah. William S. “Buck” Townsend, Kentucky-born adventurer and pioneer entrepreneur, and his family were the point’s first permanent settlers, arriving perhaps during 1848 and buying a Mormon pre-emption land claim. The Trace remained the most popular route across southern Iowa for pioneers, California-bound ’49ers and others through the 1850s.The first challenge Lucas County faced, once the town site was selected, was figuring out how to purchase it. The land was not yet officially on the market and the commissioners had no money. The county solved the first problem by making a pre-emption claim to the site. The money issue was resolved by Robinson, who purchased a military land warrant that entitled the bearer to claim 160 acres. Two years later, Robinson used the warrant to obtained title to the town site in his own name and transferred it to the county.Chariton was platted soon after it was located and the first lots, mostly around the square, sold on Nov. 5, 1849. Almost immediately, Nelson Wescott built the first store — a cabin at the intersection of what now are Braden Avenue and North Main Street. The original plat was resurveyed and corrected during 1851.*Read more atChariton.org.Every Tuesday – Chariton Public Library hosts Toddlers Twirl from 10:15-10:45 a.m. and Craft & Create from 1:00-2:00 p.m.Asset #17: Creative Activities:Young person spends three or more hours per week in lesson or practice in music, theatre or other arts.Every Friday – Chariton Public Library hosts Babies Bounce from 9:00-9:30 a.m. and Rambunctious Readers from 10:00-11:00 a.m.Asset #25: Reading for Pleasure: Young person reads for pleasure three or more hour per week.Every Tuesday – FREE Fellowship Meal at Chariton United Methodist Church, 5-6 p.m.Asset #27: Equality and Social Justice: Young person places high value on promoting equality and reducing hunger and poverty.Every Friday – Story time at Chariton Public Library, 10 a.m.Asset #25: Reading for Pleasure: Young person reads for pleasure three or more hours per week.

- DerbyDerby was platted in 1872. Today, one of the only “businesses” in town still in operation is the post office, and only on a part-time basis. in 1958, Derby Cafe opened in the old building next to the post office building. Gusta Flack operated the cafe until she retired at 86 years old in 2000. She now rests peacefully in the Derby Cemetery after passing at age 100.*Read more at theLucas Countyan blog.
- LucasThe Burlington and Missouri River Railroad Company established a station at Lucas in 1866, named after Lucas County and Robert Lucas. A plat for the town was filed on May 9, 1868 and the town was incorporated on March 18, 1887. The town grew slowly until coal was discovered in the area.*Read more atWikipedia.
- RussellIn 1864, William Nelson built the first house in what is now Russell.  In 1865, the first permanent survey was made for the railroad.  The ground was cleared and the tracks were laid through 1865-66 and completed in 1867.  The railroad company then purchased 30 acres of land from William Nelson on which the town of Russell was to be built. On October 8, 1867, the original town of Russell was platted by H. S. Russell and contained 209 lots.  This was the official beginning of Russell.* Read more atLucas County Iowa Bits of History.
- WilliamsonBy 1914 Mr. Williamson had added to the original 80 acres of land purchased by his father and included in his holdings was the area upon which the town of Williamson was located. He made plans for the town after the Des Moines-Kansas City branch of the Rock Island railroad was built through his land and donated to the railroad ground for its depot and yards. Due to the start of the mining industry in the vicinity of Williamson the town attracted residents from various parts of the country and enjoyed a rapid growth.Mr. Williamson was appointed in 1922 to serve as postmaster for the town, which he founded and held the post for 11 years. He remained until his death senior member of the Williamson & Son Lumber Co. at Williamson, which he organized when the town was started.*Read more atLucas County Bits of History.
- MurrayLike most rural Iowa towns, Murray started as a railroad town when the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad built its line through the area in 1868. The first people to come through Murray, outside of the Native Americans who inhabited the area, were the Mormons. The deep ruts cut by the wagon wheels of these early travelers are still visible today through parts of the town of Murray, which was initially the location of the Harold Burnett farm.*Read more atIAGenWeb.org.Tuesdays and Thursdays – Church of Christ Food Pantry, 9 a.m. – noonAsset #27: Equality and Social Justice: Young person places high value on promoting equality and reducing hunger and poverty.

- WeldonIn 1880, the town of Weldon was born when the Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad was built through the territory. The Weldon Depot, in operation from 1881-1946, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.*Read more atWikipedia.
- WoodburnThe iron horse was slow in reaching southern Iowa. For nearly twenty years after its first settlement, Clarke County communicated with the outside world only by stage lines. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad came into Clarke County in 1867. It was decided to steer its course through the natural valley south of the town of Ottawa. In days of slow transportation, this inconvenience of a mile was a hard blow for the merchants. Most of the merchants and residents immediately moved to Woodburn. In July of that year, the railroad came as far as what is now Woodburn, at the fork of the Brush and Gooseberry creeks. It is said that the little town that sprang up around the railroad station was called Woodburn because of the great piles of wood that were placed along the track near the station to fuel the engines. This was the only station in Jackson Township. The first train arrived in Osceola from the east on January 15, 1868.*Read more atWoodburn Blogspot.
- AftonAfton was founded in 1854 by Edward Temple. The town’s name was chosen by Temple’s wife, who is said to have named it afterFlow Gently, Sweet Afton, a popular melody of the time based on a poem about the River Afton in Scotland.Afton was soon appointed as the county seat by a local commission. Later in 1857, when the official vote was held, the fast-growing township of Highland contended for the honor of hosting the county seat. According to one recorded account, Afton narrowly won the election only after a local town leader forged a letter purportedly from the president of the Burlington and Missouri Rail Road (B&MRR) Company indicating that the new train tracks would pass through Afton instead of Highland.*Read more atunioncountyiowa.org.Daily – Books are available now for check out at theAfton Star Enterprise:Louis L’Amour Westerns, W.E.B.

- ArispeArispe was established in 1887 when the Chicago, St. Paul and Minneapolis Railroad Company built its track through Union County. The town remained little more than a store or two and several homes for much of the next decade. In 1897, an additional 65 acres were purchased and added to the town. During the next three years, a hardware store, general store, drug store, Methodist church and bank were all constructed, along with a number of new homes.By 1902, telephone lines had reached Arispe, and later in the year, work began on a new grain elevator. The first mayor, DW Stevenson, was elected in 1904. The following year, a modern four-room schoolhouse was constructed. Arispe’s population would reach its peak of 156 during the 1920 census.*Read more atunioncountyiowa.org.Saturday, Aug. 28 – Annual Arispe Hog Roast at 5:30 p.m.Asset #27: Equality and Social Justice: Young person places high value on promoting equality and reducing hunger and poverty.

- CrestonThe Burlington and Missouri Railroad established the City of Creston in 1868 as a survey site. The name ‘Creston’ was chosen because the site was located on the highest point – the crest – of the railroad line between the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Creston was eventually chosen as the division point for the new railroad, and the growing city quickly became home to additional workers, machine shops, and an enormous roundhouse with stalls for 60 engines in storage awaiting repairs or their next trip down the tracks. In fact, in the early 20th century, the Creston roundhouse was the largest American engine house west of Chicago.Creston was officially incorporated in 1871. With the growth of the railroad station came a growth in the city’s population and standing in the county. A vote was held in 1890 to move the county seat from Afton, and the measure passed due in some part to the City of Creston having already built a brand new county courthouse in anticipation of the verdict.*Read more atunioncountyiowa.org.**GIBSON MEMORIAL LIBRARY IS CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.**2,800 young Walleye were recently added to Green Valley Lake.Asset #18: Youth Programs: Young persons spends three or more hours per week in sports, clubs or organizations at school and/or in the community.

- CromwellThe city of Cromwell was founded in 1869 and was the preliminary choice for the division point on the new Burlington & Missouri River Railroad (B&MRR) line. Selection as the division point would mean rapid growth for the community as the railroad built a roundhouse, machine shops and other facilities. Unfortunately, after further examination, B&MRR surveyors decided that the nearby land would require too much work to make a division point at Cromwell practical. Instead, Creston was chosen, and its population would grow to over 7,000 while Cromwell reached just over 200 at its peak at the turn of the century.*Read more atunioncountyiowa.org.
- KentKent is a former city in Union County, Iowa, United States. The population was 52 at the 2000 census. In 2003, after years of rural flight, the tiny city was disincorporated, ending its status as an officially recognized community. As of the 2010 census, it is recognized as a census-designated place with a population of 61.*Read more atWikipedia.
- LorimorLorimor was founded in 1887 when farmer J.S. Lorimor was approached by agents of the Chicago Great Western (CGW) Railroad and asked to sell a portion of his land to be used to construct the new tracks. Instead of selling, Mr. Lorimor offered to donate the land for the right-of-way if the new station and town would be located on other portions of his farm. The deal was struck, and over the next five years, the new city quickly grew to a population of almost 400 and would eventually boast nearly 700 at its peak shortly around 1910.After a series of fires destroyed much of the town in the early 1890s, a city ordinance was passed requiring new buildings in the business district be constructed of brick or similar fire-resistant materials. Several of these brick structures are still in use today.*Read more atunioncountyiowa.org.
- ThayerThe town of Thayer was surveyed in 1867 as a possible stop on the new Chicago, Burlington and Quincy (CBQ) Railroad. A year later in 1868, the city was platted, and the first home was built.

- Garden GroveNamed by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Garden Grove was the first permanent encampment or way station on the Iowa Mormon Trail. Established in 1846, it was utilized by the Saints until 1852. Being more than a campsite, it allowed the traveling Saints to rest, make repairs, and have shelter and minimal provisions. Fences and structures were built and crops were planted to be harvested by those who came later.*Read more atDeseret News.
- Grand RiverGrand River, Iowa, was established in 1881 when E.C. Perkins laid the town out for the purpose of laying out towns along the route of the Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad and the post office branch was established, after the first school was erected in 1876 and before the city was incorporated in 1900.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- LamoniLamoni was founded as a church colony in 1879 when it was platted as a town. The earliest settlers had come approximately 30 years before the laying out of the town. The first was a group that came from 1834 to 1840 who thought they were settling Missouri. In those days, there was intense feeling and marked division over the slavery issue. The group miscalculated by a few miles on the boundary line and found they could not hold slaves in Iowa Territory. Lamoni’s real beginnings, however, do not spring from this group.*Read more atLead on Lamoni.Every Sunday and Wednesday – Community Basketball League at LHS gym from 7-9 p.m.Asset #18: Youth Programs: Young person spends three or more hours a week in sports, clubs or organizations at school and/or in the community.Every Friday – Preschool Story Time at Lamoni Public Library at 10 a.m.Asset #25: Reading for Pleasure: Young person reads for pleasure three or more hours per week.1st Monday of the month – Free nutrition counseling, health screening, healthy food vouchers (for mom and baby), and breastfeeding help and information at First Baptist Church in Lamoni from noon-5:30 p.m. Call MATURA Action for details at 641.782.8431.Asset #27: Equality and Social Justice: Young person places high value on promoting equality and reducing hunger and poverty.3rd Monday of the month, 7:00 p.m. – Lamoni Public Library hosts BookclubAsset #25: Reading for Pleasure: Young person reads for pleasure three or more hours per week.Lamoni School Supply Campaign – Donate cash/check through your local church, the Food Pantry or take to Nicole at Bank of the West.Asset #4: Caring Neighborhood: Young person experiences caring neighbors.Tuesday, Aug. 24 – Volunteer Fair at the Community Center Plaza from 6-8 p.m., showcasing approximately 40 volunteer opportunities in Lamoni.Asset #4: Caring Neighborhood: Young person experiences caring neighbors.Aug. 24, Sept. 14 and 28, Oct. 12 and 26 – Decatur County Public Health Immunization Clinics.

- LeRoyThe town of LeRoy was established in 1880 and named after early settler Leroy Buffman. The LeRoy Town Company was organized July 1880 and land was set aside in the northeast corner of the plat for a school to be know as Independent School District of LeRoy. The following season, 1881, a large one-room schoolhouse was built by Flanagan & Barkhuff, carpenters from Garden Grove. The schoolhouse was also used for religious services till November 1890 when the first Presbyterian Church was dedicated.*Read more atIowa Ghost Towns.
- LeonEarly pioneer settlers to this area found plenty of water and lots of timber along the creeks. Leon, settled in 1853 and incorporated in 1858 as a shipping point when the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad laid track through the area, is the present Decatur County seat and is situated about two miles northeast of the geographical center of the county. Thomas H. East had built a house on the town site before the town was laid out. Judge C. S. Thompson built the first house after the location of the town. Clark, Winn & Co. built the first business house, and I. N. Clark sold the first goods in September 1853.*Read more atIAGenWeb.2nd Tuesday of the month – Free nutrition counseling, health screening, healthy food vouchers (for mom and baby), and breastfeeding help and information at the Catholic Church at 1001 NW Church St. in Leon from 10 a.m.-noon & 1-7 p.m. Call MATURA Action for details at 641.782.8431.Asset #27: Equality and Social Justice: Young person places high value on promoting equality and reducing hunger and poverty.Currently – Shoe Collection Fundraiser: “Shoeing the homeless and low income.” Drop-off locations are at New-2-U and Leon Hardware and Appliances.Asset #27: Equality and Social Justice: Young person places high value on promoting equality and reducing hunger and poverty.

- PleasantonPleasanton is situated on the divide between Grand River and Little River, on the south line of the county in Hamilton Township. An addition to the village is situated in Missouri.The town was laid out in the spring of 1854 by Daniel Bartholow. The first school was taught in 1857 by M. J. S. Warmer. This schoolhouse, a log building, also served as a meeting house, erected in the early days of the town. The logs (1915) are still in use in the framework of a barn erected by H. A. Cowles.*Read more atIowa Ghost Towns.
- Van WertVan Wert was established in 1881 after the Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska extended its line to that point. Before that time, it had been a small settlement first called Florence, then Prairie City, then Prairieville. Before the railroad reached this settlement, there had been a store there owned by John Gammill and a mill, which had attracted much attention because its owner attempted to operate it by wind. Though in 1881, it was like others in the county – a steam engine mill. Now Gammill’s store had competition as W. E. Stone, D. Tharp and Mark Sanger went into business in newly built stores. As time passed, more businessmen came to Van Wert. There was a bank, a newspaper, an opera house (which was in use until it burned in 1915), and other stores and shops. Van Wert was a railroad center for when the Narrow Gauge was built. It was a station on that line as well as on the Humeston and Shenandoah, which took over the Missouri-Iowa and Nebraska at this point.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- BeaconsfieldBeaconsfield was established in 1881 when the Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad came through the northern portion of Ringgold County. The Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad later became the CB&Q Railroad which later abandoned the line in late December of 1945.There is a legend in which a man came through the countryside who could do blacksmith work. He broke a wheel and stopped to fix it. While he was working on it, a farmer came along who needed some work and suggested that the man start a blacksmith shop. He did, and a town sprang up around his shop. The blacksmith was of English origins, and he named the town growing around his shop “Beacon” in honor of Lord BEACON of England. The word “field” was added. There is a Beaconsfield in Canada, but no other town in the United States named “Beaconsfield.”*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- BentonWhen the Chicago Great Western Railroad came through the western portion of Ringgold County in 1885, the town of Benton was founded as a rail station. A news clipping proclaimed, “The name of our new town and depot is Benton. It is located in Rice Township, on uncle S[amuel] Irvin’s land joining the Nicholson farm on the south.” Before the arrival of the railroad, Benton was known as the post office Bloomington. The Chicago Great Western route coming through Benton was known as the Maple Leaf Route.Benton was located in two townships with Main Street following the boundary line of Rice and Benton Townships. In 1910, the county supervisors created a new township out of the large independent school district which was named Waubonsie Township.*Read more atIAGenWeb.Breakfast for Supper – every second Saturday of the month, 5-7 p.m. at the Benton Community Building.

- ClearfieldClearfield was platted in 1881 when the Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad was being built through that territory. The town was incorporated in 1882.Clearfield is the only school in Iowa that is known to have a Civil War monument on its grounds. Despite not even being incorporated until the 1880s, this town, 16 miles from the Missouri, border managed to get its own. But the town’s population peaked in 1900 — a statistic that is not uncommon in Iowa. Today, it has a population of only 363, down from 698 at the turn of the previous century.*Read more atWikipediaandIowa Highway Ends.
- DelphosWhen the Leon, Mount Ayr and Southwestern Railroad extended to Grant City, Missouri, in Sept. of 1880, the town of Borneo was laid out. There had been some settlement at the site before. Mr. Mike Rush sold his store and post office in Delphi (present-day Maloy) around the year 1879 and moved east to the town of Borneo along the new railroad. Frank Jordan built the first residence and established his blacksmith shop. Franklin Seaton arrived in the new town and became a partner of Mike Rush with his mercantile store. In 1885, Mr. Seaton succeeded Mr. Rush as postmaster. Other businesses soon followed: stores owned and operated by J. W. Bowman, M. H. Evans, I. M. Long; the first elevator owned and operated by I. M. Long; Harrington’s blacksmith shop; T. Bolt’s wagon shop; and D. Sclappia’s hotel. W. H. Palmer assumed a position as the station agent. The town of Borneo was renamed Delphos on Nov. 18, 1880. Delphos quickly gained a reputation as being one of the cleanest and most circumspect towns in Ringgold County.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- DiagonalIn 1880, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy (CB&Q) Railroad passed through the town of Goshen. In 1885, the Chicago Great Western Railroad (CGW) came through Knowlton. At a point approximately two miles from Goshen and Knowlton, the tracks crossed diagonally with the CB&Q passing on a creaky bridge and the CGW on firm ground. This crossing became a hub of activity with passengers changing trains as needed. Ultimately, the people felt that there was a need to provide lodging and meals for the passengers at this cross. Thus, the town of Diagonal was officially incorporated in 1888 at this crossing.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- EllstonAnticipating the arrival of the railroad across the state of Iowa, Mr. Cochran and Mr. LeFever built a general store in the town of Wirt in 1881. Upon the failure of the store six months later, it was sold. In March 1882, the Humeston & Shenandoah Railroad established Wirt as one of their stations. With the establishment of Wirt, the post office was moved from three miles northeast at Union Hill in 1884. To avoid confusion in the mail delivery between Wirt and Van Wert of Decatur County, Iowa, the town’s name was changed to Ellston in 1895.To meet the needs of area farmers and stock raisers, Ellston had a stockyards and scales located near the rails. J. E. Evans, Ellston’s first minister, helped erect a Methodist Church.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- KellertonWith the arrival of Leon, Mount Ayr and Southwestern Railroad late in 1879, the town of Kellerton was established and officially incorporated in Dec. 1881. Kellerton was the first Ringgold County town to be platted by a railroad. The town was named in honor of Judge Isaac W. Keller (1828-1923), one of the leading Ringgold County citizens. Judge Keller emigrated from Noble County, Ohio, settling in present-day Jefferson Township on June 10, 1855.The site of Kellerton was purchased from Samuel and John Tedrow, high level ground, where on a clear day, one could see Mount Ayr to the west and Leon to the east. Three and a half miles to the north was an old buffalo wallow about 20 feet deep. When the wallow filled with water, many pioneers used it as a swimming hole.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- MaloyAlthough the town of Maloy was originally named Delphi, many of the locals referred to the town as Foxtown due to the large red fox painted on a storefront in the town’s early days. The town was situated in a dense, natural grove on the eastern banks of the Platte River. There was a post office, which was established in Nov. 1880. In 1875, the town was designated as a rail town when the Chicago Great Western Railroad came through the western portion of Ringgold County in 1885. The town, renamed Maloy, was platted in 1887. Maloy’s early businesses included a tavern, general store, hardware, lumberyard, livery stable, hotel, a dray service and a blacksmith shop.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- Mount AyrIn 1851, commissioners chosen by the State Legislature located the first site of Ringgold County’s seat four miles south of the center of the county and named it “Urbana”. In January of 1855, commissioners were chosen to re-locate the county seat of Ringgold County. Their selected site was a farm which belonged to Edward A. Temple, who sold the land to the county.Mount Ayr was named “Mount” because it was the highest elevation between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and “Ayr” after the birthplace of the poet Robert Burns, Ayr, Scotland. Barton and Laura Dunning were the first settlers in the Mount Ayr vicinity, arriving in 1855 when the town was a small rural hamlet.*Read more atIAGenWeb.Wednesday, Aug. 25 – National Banana Split Day!Asset #1: Family Support: Family life provides high levels of love and support.Thursday, Aug. 26 – National Dog Day!

- ReddingA treaty entered between the Pottawattamies and the United States government on July 15, 1830, relinquished the tribe’s right to the western portion of what would become Ringgold County. The remainder of the land was ceded to the United States in 1846. When the survey of the county was completed in 1849, the land was opened to settlement.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- Shannon CityShannon City was established in 1887 and laid out June 5, 1888 on both sides of the Ringgold/Union county line with the business section located mainly on the south side in Ringgold County, the post office in Union County. It had three stores, a post office, a blacksmith shop, a boarding house and was proud of their brass band and drums corps. Between 1889 and 1891 a fire destroyed most of the businesses located in Ringgold County. Dr. Loomis led the rebuilding of the town on the north side in Union County.

- Sun Valley Lake CDPQuentin and Rita Anderson enjoyed the pristine beauty of an area located near Ellston. Not only did the Andersons enjoy the land, but they felt it should be preserved for the enjoyment of others. The Andersons researched several other lake developments in other states thinking that the 1,500 acre tract of timbered hillsides would be an ideal spot for a recreational facility.In 1969, applications were made to the State of Iowa; the land was surveyed and cleared. Anderson, who had experience in conservation work and owned construction equipment, began to realize his dream.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- TingleySeveral settlers in Ringgold County who wanted mail services met around the year of 1867 in the home of William “Tingley” Cornwall with the purpose of establishing a post office at his home. They agreed to take turns carrying the mail from the nearest point (Afton in Union County) to connect with the stage line. The name “Silver Street” was submitted to the U.S. Post Office Department, but it was rejected because there was another post office by the same name in Iowa at the time. It was suggested that Cornwall send in his own name, which he did. Consequently, the name “Tingley” was approved. Tingley Cornwall was appointed as the post master.When the Humeston and Shenandoah Railroad – in partnership with the Burlington and Wabash Companies – came through the northern part of Ringgold County in 1881, the railroad purchased the land for the future site of Tingley from area farmers. Tingley was incorporated in 1883 with 211 residents and named indirectly for Tingley Cornwall.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
- AllertonAllerton was platted by the Rock Island Railroad when it came through the area in 1870. It became a legal town in 1874 and had a peak population of 1,600 in 1913.[5]Allerton and Corydon were rivals for the Wayne County seat. Several times, during the early establishment of the two towns, county records were moved back and forth, sometimes illegally, before Corydon was declared the county seat.Allerton used to have its own school system and then merged with Lineville and Clio to form ACL Community School. In 1966, Allerton voted to leave ACL and merge with Cambria-Corydon to form Wayne Community School. Classes were held for different grades at the Allerton school until the school house was deemed deficient in the latter part of the 20th century. Classes are now held in Corydon.*Read more atWikipedia.
- ClioClio was part of Lineville-Clio Community Schools until the district voted to disband in 2010. Lineville-Clio merged into Wayne on July 1, 2011. It was known as ACL Community for its namesake town names of Allerton, Clio, Lineville until 1966 when Allerton voted to join Cambria-Corydon to form Wayne Community Schools.*Reda more atWikipedia.
- CorydonCorydon acquired its name in a rather unorthodox way. The men who selected the site and laid out the plats could not agree on a name. Springfield and Anthony were both suggested but met with disapproval, so a game of poker was suggested. The winner would then name the town. Judge Seth Anderson won the game and named the town after his old hometown of Corydon, Indiana. There remain only three Corydons in all of this country: Iowa, Indiana and Kentucky.The town of Corydon was laid out and platted in 1851. It was late that same year that it was designated as the county seat town. There had been a struggle between the citizens of Allerton and Corydon to be the county seat. It was that same year that Lewis Miles brought his family from Ohio. He purchased quite a bit of land for $1.25/acre. Much of the town of Corydon is built on that land, and many abstracts carry the Miles name. The log cabin in Dotts Park (near the Prairie Trails Museum) was built in replica of the cabin for the Lewis Miles family.*Read more atCity of Corydon, Iowa.
- HumestonFounded in 1872, the town was named by railroad official S.W. Mallory for Ava Humeston who owned the land on which the town was platted. The land was purchased by a couple of gentlemen named Perkins and Manchester, and H.B. Scott was the agent in charge of procuring the 240 acres. A post office was established in 1872, and the town was incorporated in 1881. The population in 1880 was 645 compared to current day at 494.*Read more atThe 29th State.
- LinevilleLineville has been called the oldest town in Wayne County but was not noted on early maps or in the 1850 state line survey. The small town most likely attracted settlers from a nearby short-lived community called Grand River after the state line dispute was settled. Lineville was platted in 1858.Because part of the town is in Missouri and part in Iowa, it was named Lineville. The town square sits on the Iowa-Missouri border with the business on the south side of the square in South Lineville, Missouri. When Wayne County was dry, liquor by the drink could be purchased at the bars on the Missouri side of the square.*Read more atWikipedia.

- Promise CityPostal service was established in the Wayne County, Iowa, community of Promise City in August 1856. When service was discontinued in the nearby towns of Clio and Millerton in 2006, Promise City became the smallest city in the county with an active post office location. The 2000 census indicated 105 residents, down from a peak population of 274 in 1910.*Read more atIowa BackroadsandHeritage 1865.
- SeymourSeymour is, like Allerton, indebted for its existence to the railroad, which was built through Wayne County in 1870. It was laid out by J. C. Fox, William Wade, Hiram Evans and H. S. Rogers, who gave every alternate lot to the railroad company in order to get their good will, advertising, etc. Several names were suggested for the new town. Three-quarters of a mile west of the town site is a tall cottonwood tree, now inconspicuous from a second growth of timber, which has been a landmark for the farmers ever since the first settlement of the county. The “lone tree” was referred to in giving directions to travelers and known to all within 30 or 40 miles. It was the point of rendezvous for many a wolf hunt and picnic party. Many therefore, favored the name of “Lone Tree” for the town, and though this failed of selection, its memory is perpetuated in the name of the only newspaper published here—the Lone Tree Press.*Read more atIAGenWeb.
