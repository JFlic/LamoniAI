As Graceland evaluated its facilities over the past several years, one thing was clear: it was too costly to renovate and maintain the swimming pool and it was an insurance risk, so during the Morden renovation, the contractors filled in the pool with the hopes that the structure could be turned into a state-of-the-art training facility.

That dream took its first step toward coming to life with a lead gift of $800,000 by Greg ’75 and Holly Lennon ’78 Henson. The vision for the facility (located on the south side of Hampton Center) is one that will incorporate strength and conditioning and also serve as a classroom for the health and movement science department.

BRING THE STINGThe early rendering shown above reflects Athletic Director Brady McKillip’s vision for what the indoor multipurpose training space might become — a synthetic turf football-style field in the center and weight training equipment on either side.

“We chose to make this gift because we see this as a valuable recruitment tool for Graceland. This facility should boost student enrollment and improve Graceland’s athletic programs. Student-athletes deserve to have a top-notch training facility on campus. This addition will be a gamechanger for Graceland athletics.”

GREG HENSON ’75
