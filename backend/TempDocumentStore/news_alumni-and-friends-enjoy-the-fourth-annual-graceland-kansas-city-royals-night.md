June 20, 2018

The song that has become a staple at every baseball game across North America since its introduction at Major League Baseball games during the 1934 World Series.There’s just something about a stadium full of spectators rooting for their team and singing in unison the seventh-inning-stretch tune just as it was Friday, June 15, 2018, at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The hometown Kansas City Royals, 2015 World Series Champions challenged the current 2017 World Series Champions, the Houston Astros in the first of three games.In the midst of a mid-June heat wave, the stadium seats were filled with a sea of blue and white Royals fans. There were no shortage of Graceland alumni and friends who came out to root for their team, 142 to be exact. The party opened with tailgating under a huge tent in Lot N with hamburgers, hot dogs and all the fixings, then the march into Kauffman Stadium and hike to our seats. We cheered, booed, laughed and chatted, ate peanuts, and drank soda. The end of the evening brought a fantastic fireworks show we all oohed and awed over.The fourth annual alumni event brought an electric evening of camaraderie and excitement. It was a first time for President Draves at this event and a first time for a GU memorabilia giveaway. What a fun-filled night and memorable way to spend Father’s Day weekend!
