The White House awarded Graceland University Professor of EducationDennis McElroy, PhD, the President’s Volunteer Service Award (silver level) for his work with theInternational Society for a Technology in Education(ISTE) at the 2019 ISTE conference in Philadelphia. McElroy serves on ISTE’s Teacher Education Network leadership team planning and providing learning programs for thousands of educators around the world and is the organization’s president-elect for 2019-20. This is the third straight year McElroy has been recognized with this honor.

According to their website, the President’s Council on Service and Civic Participation founded the President’s Volunteer Service Award in 2003 to recognize the important role of volunteers in America’s strength and national identity. This award honors individuals whose service positively impacts communities in every corner of the nation and inspires those around them to take action too. The PVSA has continued under each administration, honoring the volunteers who are using their time and talents to solve some of the toughest challenges facing our nation. Led by theCorporation for National and Community Serviceand managed in partnership withPoints of Light, this program allows Certifying Organizations to recognize their most exceptional volunteers.

Graceland is proud of the work McElroy has contributed to this organization and the country, and how his experiences positively impact Graceland students.
