The campus’ secondFOUNTAIN, located near the east door of the administration building, was constructed in 1939. The fountain was dismantled in the summer of 1972 and replaced with a sidewalk after becoming the constant victim of campus pranks.

In August 2003, the first brick was purchased for theALUMNI BRICK PLAZA, which is now located in the space the fountain once occupied. All profit from the sales of bricks boosts the Alumni Endowed Scholarship. To date, $63K has been raised simply by the sale of personalized bricks.

KGRA was Graceland’s longest-lasting campusRADIO STATIONfrom 1949-75.

KBUZ began as a SIFE (now Enactus) project in 2005. It is now available around the world from any internet browser thanks to the passion of Paul Davis ’77, the current sponsor, and several student DJs.

Basketball ws one of the only two sports available to women during Graceland’s initial years and was only offered as an exercise activity. Formal organization of a women’s basketball team came in 1912 and finally achieved intercollegiate varsity status in 1965-66.

Graceland WOMEN’S BASKETBALL now recruits student-athletes from all over the country and competes against 93 teams in the NAIA Division I.

PATRONESS HALL (I) was a women’s dormitory that was erected in 1908-09. It was destroyed by fires Jan. 2, 1927, while most of the residents were at home for Christmas break. Heat from the fire was so intense that it melted bricks on nearby Briggs Hall.

PATRONESS HALL (II) was built in 1952 and served as a women’s dormitory for more than a quarter century. Fire also twice threatened the new Patroness Hall during its dormitory years, but ti survived and now houses the financial services department, the CAP Center and Human Resources.

The campus POST OFFICE was relocated from the administration building as part of the 196-62 east-side addition to the MSC.Today, the ORIGINAL MAILBOXES remain in the same location in the MSC. While technology has changed how we communicate, Graceland students still enjoy getting real mail from friends and family. Join a new Graceland tradition and send a note of encouragement to your old mailbox, and make a current student’ stay!

In 1913, Frederick M. Smith presented Graceland with a SUNDIAL in recognition of the 15th anniversary of his graduation. The sundial sat in many places through the years, until it was removed during the 1970’s due to vandalism and natural deterioration.

In 1990, donations funded a new casting of the sundial’s pointer, in addition to a new pedestal and base. The SUNDIAL was placed west of the MSC, where it is today.

The UNITS were student housing facilities built in 1975 and alternated between resident rooms and office space throughout the years.

The SMALL & THOMAS APARTMENTS, named after Richard Small and Norma (Thomas) Small, opened in Fall 2011 in the location of the old Units. The apartments offer 48 two-bedroom unfurnished apartments, have a full-size kitchen, two full bathrooms and private laundry, and are available to upperclassmen only.

The Playshop was built by students in the Industrial Department in 1911 to serve as the campus’ first central heating plant. With the construction of the new physical plant, it was remodeled in 1949 as a small THEATER and was demolished in 1982.

An integral part of the original Shaw Center, the SHAW FAMILY AUDITORIUM has been a center for student life since 1982. Renovated in 2012, it remains one of the largest spaces on campus where students can gather and enjoy the fine arts.
