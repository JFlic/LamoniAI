Welcome to Graceland.

Welcome to a place where everyone is just that —welcome. Here, we know that college is not just about studying, and the experiences you have outside the classroom are just as important.

That’s why we’re all about creating an inclusive environment and community for anyone who wants to be a Gracelander.No matter what.In fact, our house system is based on one simple, unwavering principle:

“Everyone who is here belongs here just because they are here, andfor no other reason.”

At Graceland, you aren’t just placed in a random dorm but become part of a “house.” Each floor of our residence halls has its own house name, symbol, colors and student-elected council, all based around the principles of inclusion, individuality and community.

There’s always something to do on the Graceland campus. Check our student events calendar often to stay in the know.

Fall 2023 Fact Book

In Yellowjacket territory, there are tons of varsity and intramural sports for you to get in the game or cheer on from the stands. We’ve got all the classics, like football, basketball, volleyball and softball, but we also throw a few recreational activities into the mix, like Jack and Jill soccer and tape ball.

Our main, residential campus is located about an hour south of Des Moines in Lamoni, Iowa — a small town that’s anything but ordinary.

Less than 10 miles from downtown Kansas City, you’ll find our urban campus — and home to our school of nursing — located in Independence, Missouri.
