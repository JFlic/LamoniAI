## Treatment  of  the  Prisoner.

Of  course Aguinaldo  cannot  be treated as an ordinary prisoner.  That is,  he will  not be  given  the same treatm ent accorded a private soldier, as he is  of  greater  importance,  and his  ability to  do  harm  if released is much greater,  perhaps,  than  th at of any other one man in  the islands,  al­ though he is  rapidly  losing his hold upon the  people. In  discussing  the capture  of  Aguinaldo  the secretary of  war said  the time had long passed ·when it was  the  custom  to stand a man  up  against  a  wall  and  shoot him to death. In  fact,  the  adminis tration did not wish  to  punish  those ·who  had  been  in  rebellion,  but  it wished  to treat them with mercy and to show the Filipinos that the United States is honest in its promise to give the inhabitants of the Philippines the the full measure of  civil government when they were  able  to  administer it.

A general amuesty will be granted to those  who  surrender  their  arms and  take  the  oath  of  allegiance. This amnesty will  not be grauted to those who have  grossly  violated  the rules  of  warfare,  committing  such acts as beheading prisoners,  burying them alive,  or  mercilessly killing na­ tives friendly  to  the  United States. A  full  pardon cannot  be  granted these rebels,  but  if  Aguinaldo  will issue  a  proclamation  calling  upon this class,  which  is  really  tbe only class still  holdihg  out,  to lay  down its arms,  those  surrendering may be given more liberal  treatment  than if they keep up the fight until captured.

Old  friends  in  this  county  will  be pained  to  learn  of  the  misfortunes that have overtaken Mr. L. Madaraz, who sold  his  farm near Grand  River and  went to Florida a few years  ago, where he invested in an orange plan­ tation,  which  has  proven  very  un­ profitable,  and  he  can  neither  sell nor  rent  it. A  short  time  ago  he started with  his  wife,  daughter,  and two  sons,  one  of  whom  is  blind,  to find a home  in  Missouri. Mr.  Fran­ cis Varga is in receipt of a letter from a married  daughter residing in Web­ ster  county,  Missouri,  with  the  sad news  that  her  father  who  is  now eighty-nine years old. had been taken sick,  and  there is  but  little  hope for his recovery. It  is indeed a sad case.

The most radical and unreasonable men  are  usually  those  who have  de­ serted one faith  to embrace another. Charles  A.  Towne.  'silver  republi­ can," whom the democrats and  popu­ lists of  Minnesota  put iu  the  senate for brief term as a reward  for leaving the  republican  partv.  declares  that Funston's capture of Anguinaldo was ' treachery,'  and  finds  no  cause  of joy in  the success of our soldiers.
