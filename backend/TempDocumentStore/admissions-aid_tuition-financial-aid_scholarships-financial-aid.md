Save Your Spot for Fall 2025 on the Lamoni Campus

Graceland University believes in the shared responsibility of family, government and the institution for facilitating a student’s attendance at the college or university that best meets his or her intellectual, emotional, spiritual, physical and social needs.

Your college education will be one of the most important investments you and your family make.

Financial aid can help you bridge the gap between your own resources and the cost of education. We emphasize bridging the gap because you and your family are primarily responsible for your college expenses. Graceland University Student Financial Services makes every effort to assist you and your family in obtaining the financial aid funds that you may need to meet expenses if your family’s resources are not adequate.

Students must apply for financial aid each year by filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and submitting other required forms. Federal aid awarded by Student Financial Services is not automatically renewed. You will need our Federal School Code, which is 001866, to complete the FAFSA.

To complete the FAFSA, go tostudentaid.gov.

Awards are made on a first-come, first-served basis. Although students can apply for financial aid throughout the year, funding for some financial aid programs may be depleted prior to May 1 for the upcoming academic year.

Your FAFSA should be submitted as soon as possible in December.

Federal student aid through the Department of Education is available for qualifying students in the form of

In addition to the main Graceland award, Graceland also offers several competitive scholarships. In most cases, your total Graceland award will not exceed the cost of tuition.

Graceland alumni can receive a 15% discount on graduate tuition.

Funding for Graceland University’s student employment program comes from the Federal Work-Study program (FWS) and from Graceland University funds. Student employment is considered a type of financial aid. Campus employers are encouraged to give priority in hiring to students who have demonstrated financial need for employment by filing the FAFSA.
