Graceland is excited to announce that its subsidiary,SkillPath, recently named Michele Markey chief executive officer.

A 25-year veteran of the learning and development industry, Markey joined SkillPath in 2018 as the vice president of training operations. She was promoted to general manager in 2019, and in April 2020, the board of trustees appointed Markey as interim CEO.

“Michele has demonstrated exceptional ability as interim CEO, while guiding SkillPath through this very challenging environment,” said Bob Ackerley, chairman of the board. “As SkillPath continues to expand its digital training offerings in response to the current business climate, the board fully endorses Michele as the right person to lead the company forward.”

Throughout her career, Markey has assisted hundreds of companies with developing their professional talent, as an independent training facilitator and by leading talent development teams at major U.S. companies. Since Markey became interim CEO at SkillPath, she has implemented strategies to increase revenue, despite limited opportunities for in-person training events due to the pandemic. Under her direction, SkillPath’s virtual instructor-led training programs and digital eLearning opportunities have grown exponentially since April.

“I am honored and excited to be leading the operations and people at SkillPath,” Markey said. “Our new virtual business model and talented management team have uniquely positioned the company for further growth in this challenging economic environment.”

Graceland purchased SkillPath in 1995, and revenue from SkillPath’s learning and development programs has provided millions of dollars in scholarships to Graceland students over the past 25 years.

“Michele has shown herself to be a strong leader, especially during this global pandemic,” said Graceland President Patricia H. Draves. “Her ability to guide SkillPath through a fundamental pivot in their business model and build on our already rich partnership gives me confidence in SkillPath’s ability to continue to grow.”
