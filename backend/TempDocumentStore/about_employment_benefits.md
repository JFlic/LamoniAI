All full-time employees are eligible for the following benefits. Part-time employees are eligible for health and dental insurance without a Graceland subsidy. Premiums are deducted the month before coverage period.

Benefits begin the month after hire date.

Graceland provides a variety of benefits to its employees.

Graceland subsidizes two different health plan deductible levels to meet employees' needs. Health plan premiums are paid on a pre-tax basis and are based on the annual salary of the employee and the deductible level chosen.

Graceland offers dental insurance. Monthly premiums are deducted on a pre-tax basis and Graceland helps employees pay for this insurance plan.

Voluntary vision insurance is available to employees. Employees pay the full premium, which ranges from $6/month for single coverage to $18/month for family coverage.

Graceland has generous paid time off allowances. Typically, full-time, 12-month employees receive 4 weeks of vacation, approximately 13 paid holidays and 12 sick/personal days every fiscal year. Paid time off is awarded at the beginning of every fiscal year so you don’t have to wait to earn it throughout the year. New employees receive a prorated allowance at the start of their employment, depending on their start date.

Pre-tax money set aside for eligible medical expenses/daycare expenses.

Employees may purchase this voluntary insurance policy to cover themselves and/or their family members at either $10,000 or $30,000.  This benefit pays a lump sum benefit following the diagnosis of a covered critical illness like heart attack, cancer, stroke, and others.  Rates are locked in at the age the policy is purchased at.  Rates do not go up when you go into the next age bracket.  Rates are based on age and smoker/non-smoker status.

Employees are eligible to contribute their own money into this 403(b) plan immediately upon hire. Employees may contribute pre-tax or after-tax money into this plan.
