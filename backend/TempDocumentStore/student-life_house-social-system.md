# Graceland University Student Life: House Social System

Save Your Spot for Fall 2025 on the Lamoni Campus

At Graceland, inclusivity and belonging aren’t just words, they’re actions. A huge part of our dedication to these values comes from our unique house system.

The Graceland house system combines on-campus housing and student government to create an instant community for all our first-year students — and that community continues through graduation and beyond. Although each house is unique, they all focus on the same things: coming together, having fun, and making your voice heard in your campus community.

- Each floor of our residence halls is separated into different houses that have their own name, symbol, colors and traditions.
- Every student is assigned to a house starting their first year, and they remain a member of their house through graduation.
- There are, on average, 45 students per house.
- Each house elects a president, who helps to lead and unite all house members.
- Members of the house elect six students, known as the house council, to hold key leadership positions and plan social, intramural, diversity and religious events and activities.
- Every house has a diversity representative.
- House meetings are held once a week.
- Although participation in house activities is completely voluntary, the house system is a favorite with Graceland students.
