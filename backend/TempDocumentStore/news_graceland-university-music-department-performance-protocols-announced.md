# Music Department Releases New Performance Protocols

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/news/graceland-university-music-department-performance-protocols-announced/#top

September 25, 2020

To facilitate guest access to on-campus performance events, the music department has partnered with HomeTown Ticketing to provide online ticketing for the Fall 2020 semester. This will include performances involving the symphonic band, orchestra, chamber singers, concert choir, Graceland Harmonium, percussion ensemble, jazz band, sax quartet, and any additional music department ensembles that participate in any performance with the listed ensembles.

All performances will require an active ticket to attend. Additionally, there will be limited capacity for only specific audience groups, and safety protocols will be enforced. The link to HomeTown Ticketing can be found on the Graceland website on theShaw Ticket Office page.

In order to minimize the risks and potential exposure of COVID-19 for spectators, student performers and staff, the following protocols will be implemented.

Permitted Attendance Groups

Those who wish to attend fall semester performances will be limited to the restricted capacity for the specific performance venue. Effective Oct. 1, members of the Graceland community, student family members and interested members of the local community will be allowed to attend music performances held on campus. This includes but is not limited to current Graceland University students, faculty and staff, families of Graceland students, alumni, local supporters, as well as donors both from the local community and from elsewhere.
