Doug graduated from Graceland in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts in History, a minor in Political Science, and an endorsement in Secondary Education. As a Graceland student Doug served as Closson House President and played varsity basketball, earning Academic All-American recognition.

Following Graceland Doug continued his education earning a Masters of Arts in Sport Management from the University of San Francisco. Currently, he is working toward a Master of Arts in Peace and Social Transformation through the Graceland Seminary. Doug has spent time working for Positive Coaching Alliance and as a Recreation Director, combining his passions for athletics and education. He also was a stay-at-home dad for many years.

Doug has remained connected to Graceland through serving on the Graceland Alumni Board of Directors and through his leadership in Spectacular, a week long music, sports, leadership and art camp held every summer at Graceland. Currently, Doug and his wife, Ginelle ’01, reside in the Kansas City area with their two children.

Graceland was and continues to be a transformational part of my life journey. It’s difficult to articulate all the ways Graceland has impacted my life. My experiences at Graceland provided lifelong friendships and memories while the education prepared me for the variety of opportunities life continues to present. I am excited to join the Graceland team and help others discover all that Graceland has to offer.
