The C h r o n i c l e appears  this issue under  a  new  heading  and  with the addition  of  Mr John  Scott  to  the firm. Mi\  Scott  is  well known  to  a great many of  our  readers  and  will need no  introduction  from  us. His connection  with  the  Herald  Office for  about  30  years  has  given  him large  experience  in  the  'art preser­ vative' and  will  be  of  great benefit to  the  C h r o n i c l e . We  have  also added to  our  equipment  a 6 column quarto Campbell cylinder press,  that will  be  in  position  some  time  next week. This addition  will put us in a position to  do  our  own  press work, and give us  added  facilities  for  Job work.

A  n o t a b l e   change  took place  in newspaper  circles  last  week,  when the Chicago Record was purchased by the owners of the  Times-Herald  and tbe  two  papers united  under  the name  of the  Herald-Record. The two papers were among the very best papers  in  the  city  of  Chicago,  and that  means  that  they  were  among the  very  best  in  the  world,  and their union  brings  to  the new paper some  exceptionally strong points, which are sure  to  make it a winner Mr.  L arson,  who  made  the Record what it  was,  in  thus disposing of  tho child of his enei'gv  does so to  devote his time move closely to another crea­ ture  of  his  development,  the News, which enjoys the  largest circulation in  th e c ity  of Chicago

In the chaD ge  which  thus gives  to the reading public of this part of the United  States  the  Record-Herald causes  the  disappearance  of  one  of Chicago's  'land-marks,'  the  Times, which  thus entirely loses its identity by  being  twice  merged  into  other papers,  and its name  dropped in  the last transaction

No doubt Mr. Kohlsaat feels proud of his  new  paper,  and  he will probably succeed in giving  the readers of both  papers  no  reason  to

feel  regret  for  the  change  of  hands of the  Record  and  its  merging into the Herald. Success  to  the Record Herald!

## Railroad  Combine.

T h e r e   has  been  considerable talk of late  in  railroad  circles  about the Burlington  system having  passed into the  control  of  J.  J.  Hill,  who is directing  the  Northern  and  Union Pacific  systems According  to  re­ ports this  was  accomplished  by  the Morgan-Harriman syndicate pur­ chasing a controling  interest  in  tbe road  an<i  subsequently  leasing  the road to Hill. In some places this re­ port is denied.

Whether or  not  the  report is true as  co  the  Burlington  system,  it  is clearly  evident  that  the  railroads are  fast  accomplishing  what  is  the equivalent of pooling their interests, and  that  despite  the  fact  that  the government  has  legislated  against pooliug. It is  not pooling,  however, for the  combination  is  accomplished in  a strictly  legitmate  and  practical way,  namely,  by  the  syndicate  pur­ chasing  controling  interests  in  the various l'oads they desire  to combine and  this  prosecution  of  the  'com­ munity  of  interest' plan  has  prog­ ressed  until  now,  if  we  can  believe the  r>port  concerning  the  Burling­ ton,  there is  a  grand  total  of  94.273 miles  of  railroad  controlled  by  the syndicate  promulgating  the  combi­ nation.

This is  the result of  a belief on  the part  of  the  railroad  managers  that co-operation  is  more  profitable  than competition,  as  the  Brooklyn  Eagle puts it;  and  that  paper  also  points out the economical  soundness of  the doctrine  by  stating  the  fact  that millions  of  dollars  can be  saved which  are  now  wasted  because  of the  inharmouy  which  exists  among the  management  of  roads. Atten­ tion is also  called  to  how  we are in­ debted  to various labor'  saving

machines,  such  as  the  'loom,  the steam flouring mill, the sewing machine  and  such  things'  which 'have given  to us cheaper bread and better  clothing  than  our  ancestors had.' Then, classing the 'com­ munity  of  interest' plan  as  one  of the  'labor  savers,'  the  Eagle  says:

The  ruon  w ho  invented  th e  com­ munity of in te re st  idea devised  a  lab o r saving  com m ercial  machine  and  he only obeyed  th e   irresistible forces  th a t are  compelling-  m en  to  prevent all  pos­ sible w aste in   th e   conduct  of  business as well  as in  th e   m anufacture  of  vari­ ous  com modities. Whether  th e  m ak­ ers of  s ta tu te   la w s   like it  o r  n o t,  and whether  the  closest  economists  think t h a t  i t   is wise,  th e   ' com m unity  of  in­ terest'' p lan   w ill  continue  to   govern the  m anagers  of  the  transportation concerns u n til  a   b e tte r  one is  offered in its  place. What  the  ultim ate  goal may be  tow ard  w hich  we  are  tending no man knows,  and  it  is not necessary to w orry  one's  self very  much  ab o u t it. We do know, however, that  th e  world is seeking  o u t  th e   way  to produce the greatest  possible  results  w ith  th e  ex­ penditure  of t h e le a s t am ount  of energy,  and  th a t  it  will continue  th a t search ju s t a s a   stre a m  of  w a te r,  in  its flow  to  th e  sea,  follow s  th e  p a th of least resistance.

No  doubt  our  'calamity'  friends see in  the  combination  dark visions of  another  tentacled  monster,  and will vituperate  the  'octopus' in choicest  'opposition'  language;  but the  Brooklyn "Eagle has tersely stated the  tru th   of  the  m atter in  a t­ tributing  the whole  thing  to  the operations  of  economical  laws  and placing  it  outside  the legislative realm. Statute  enactment  cannot possibly control  absolutely  what de­ pends  for  its raison  d'etre  upon economic laws  and  principles Rail­ roads  were  not  brought  into  exis­ tence by statute  enactment,  neither have the ' legislators' been tlie potent  factors  in  their  steady  and rapid  growth. The  combination  is but a natural sequence  to  past developments,  and with  the editor of the  Eagle  we  are  disposed  to  be­ lieve that  the community of  interest plan  will  stay  until  its  mission  work will  be  completed,  when  something better comes  to  take its place.

## Otis  Sees  Immediate  Peace.

Chicago,  March  2D -'Aguinaldo's capture is  the end  of the insurrection and it proves  Gen.  Funston  to  be a great scout,' declared Major General El well S.  Otis

' With the  taking  of tbe insurgent leader what little  opposition  existed to the  American  rule  will  cease,  I will  venture  th a t  more peaceful con­ ditions  exist  in  the  islands  today than  have  existed for  twenty-five years.

'Gen.  Funston's  feat in capturing Aguinaldo  was  brave  and  deserves commendation. He  and his  officers and men  risked  their  lives  in  the hands of the  natives,  and  their  bra­ very as  easily  might  have led  them to death  as success.

' Every  army  officer  will  rejoice over the capture  of  the  wary insur­ gent,  and  there  doubtless  is a sort of a ratification  meeting  being  con­ ducted  in  Manila. The  best class of the natives will be  happy at Gen. Funston's success.

'There now  remains  but two Fili­ pino  officers  of any  importance  in the islands,  who still retain  their hos­ tility toward  the  United  States. These are Generals  Caillies and Luc­ ban. They,  no  doubt,  will  become discouraged,  their  few followers  will desert,  and  they  to  will be captured or  will  surrender.

'It long had  been  Gen.  Funston's hope that he  would  be able  to cap­ ture  Aguinaldo While in  command in the  Philippines I sent  him  on  a scouting expedition  through  the ter­ ritory  in  which  ho  realized  his  hope. It is  a  p art  of the wildest  country found in  the  island-. Funston  pro­ bably  was  the  best  posted  man on the  nature  of the  country  in  the army. It is  my  understanding that he effected  the  capture  about ninety miles  inland. To  reach  that  point Funston  and  his  men  had  to march through mountains covered with undergrowth. There  were no  roads and only  narrow  bridle  paths  here and there. When  the  nature of the country  is taken  into  consideration the capture is  the more remarkabfe. 'As to the effect  of  the capture of

Aguiifaldo will  have on  our affairs  in the islands,  I  believe that it  will  has­ ten  the  time  when  absolute  peace wilHfe restored Of course,  the peo­ ple  will have to be protected for some time \V>  come,  but  I  think  in  a  few months or a year  the  people will  be able-'-^o protect themselves. The capture  will  result in  the decrease  of of the military demands of the Philip­ pines. We now ai'e withdrawing our troops as rapidly as  possible. Rob­ ber bands are operating  in  the  inte­ rior and they will continue to rob  the people as long as  they  can,  but  they will  be suppressed.

'Gen. Lucban is said to have made neai'ly a half million  out of the insur­ rection  by robbing  the  natives. On one pretext  and  another  he  would secure  their  property  and appropri­ ate tbe proceeds. He  is  understood to have sent  over  $300,000  from  the islands  to  China  for  safe  keeping. Naturally the  natives  have  become tired  of th at kind  of a thing.

'Aguinaldo  is not  an  educated man,  as is generally understood,  but he is cunning  and  possesses certain abilities as  a  leader. Owing  to  the superstitions of the  ignorant classes he  was long looked  upon  a sort of a god. His capture will dispel this  de­ lusion.'  Personally,  he is honest,  in my opinion,  but  he  is  intensely  am­ bitious. He  has  been  actuated  by that ambition  rather  than  by  desire of  gain,  as  have  some  of  the  other leaders.

'Just what  punishment  should be meted out to  the  insurgent leader is a problem. His  trial  by  a  m ilitary commib'sion  would  be  the  natural coui'se of  procedure,  and  a  sentence of death  would  be  possible. We are not  a  bloodthirsty  people,  however, and  some  other  form of  punishment may  be  fixed Should  Aguinaldo take  tho  oath  of  allegiance  to  the United  States,  I  am  inclined to think  he is  enough  of  a  man  to ob­ serve it in  the  future.'' ,

## ; .jowa  and  tlie Tariff.

The  Now  York  Times says  ' there is  something in  the  air of Iowa  that breeds  independence  and  courage  '' I t refers  to  the  action  of  Senator Grimes in defeating the impeachment of Andrew  Johnson  and  to  ' tbe  si­ lent but powerful  influence' recently exerti d by Senator  Allison  to defeat the ship subsidy  bill.

There  is  everv reason to  believe that  when  the  next  Congress  meets and  there  comes  before  it-as  asuredlv  will  be  the case-the question of reducing tariff  duties,  which  lend themselves  to  the  illegitimate  pur­ poses  of  trusts  and  combines, the Iowa Congressmen  will  be  found  as strongly in  favor  of  judicious  tariff reduction as  is  Mr.  Roberts. Iowa Republicans never have favored  that doctrineof excessive protection which has  obtained  in  Pennsylvania  and some  other  eastern states. Their Representatives will not be found vot­ ing for the continuance of a diseased form  of  protection which  enables American  manufacturers  to  control the home market and  charge  domes­ tic  consumers  high  prices  for goods while  selling  these  same  goods  to foreign  consumers  at  much  lower prices.

But  it  is  not  in  the  interest  of American  consumers  alone  that ex­ cessive  tariff  duties  should  be  reduced. As  Mint  Director  Roberts has  pointed out,  it  is  in  the interest of  the  manufacturers  who  have be­ come exporters They will  find  their foreign  markets  seriously  interfered with  by  retaliatory  legislation  if  the Dmgloy  tariff law  is  to  be  treated  as if one  of  the laws  of  the  Modes  and Persians.  Some of the manufacturers arc coming  to  see  this To be pro­ tected  abroad  they  must  waive un­ necessary  prot. i  t ion  at  home

In  this  great  W'>rk  of  revising  the tariff so  as  to secure  better markets abroad  for  American  manufacturers and  agricultural  products  the  Re­ publican  Congressmen, not from Iowa  alone  but  from  other western states should  be foremost.
