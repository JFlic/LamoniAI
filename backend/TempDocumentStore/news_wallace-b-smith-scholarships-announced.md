On a beautiful Friday morning in Lamoni, Iowa, Graceland University announced the recipients of this year’s Wallace B. Smith scholarship during the Community of Christ youth camp SPECTACULAR. The camp gathers high school students from across the world for a week of leadership activities, learning, sports, and other activities, on Graceland’s sprawling Lamoni campus.

This year, the scholarship was boosted by a $1 million gift from the Kathy & Joel Ross Inspired Leadership Fund, aimed at bringing more Community of Christ youth to Graceland. Their generosity established the Wallace B. Smith scholarship as four half-tuition scholarships and two full-tuition scholarships, given to students entering their senior year in high school.

For over 50 years, the University has hosted Spectacular and has been giving away the Wallace B. Smith scholarship since 1978. The scholarship, named after Community of Christ (then RLDS) president emeritus Wallace B. Smith, who passed away in September of 2023. Smith was a transformational leader for the church, leading it for 18 years, and presiding over many incredible changes, including the inclusion of women to priesthood roles.

The scholarship is competitive; students must fill out an application and go through an interview process. A committee made up of both church members and university officials selects the recipients, who receive the scholarship, which is renewable up to four years.

Vice President for Enrollment and Strategic Growth Deb Skinner said, “The pool of applicants this year was exceptional. We are looking forward to seeing these students on campus and the impact they will have both here at Graceland and in the world.”

This year’s recipients were drawn from a competitive pool of applicants. The university is proud to announce the winners.

In attendance at this year’s ceremony were honored guests: Prophet/President of Community of Christ Steve Veazey, Daughters of Wallace B. Smith Carolyn (Smith) Wells ’79 and Julie Smith ’84, as well as Graceland representatives Interim President Joel Shrock, PhD, and Vice President for Enrollment and Strategic Growth Deb Skinner, MSEd. The ceremony was emceed by Dean of the Community of Christ Seminary at Graceland University, Zac Harmon-McLaughlin, DMin.

Graceland University is more than just a school – it is an education that endures. Founded in 1895 and sponsored by Community of Christ, Graceland is committed to creating a community of radical belonging where passionate, caring, and dedicated individuals put their relationships with students first. Radical belonging creates a safe space for self-discovery enabling Graceland students to become the bold leaders and changemakers the world needs. The University’s traditional undergraduate campus in Lamoni, Iowa, is complemented by a campus in Independence, Mo., and an additional location in Mission, Kan.
