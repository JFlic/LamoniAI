Nicole teaches physical education and health classes such as Children’s Health and Development, Adaptive PE, Teaching Team and Individual Sports and Foundations of Physical Education. After getting her education from Graceland University and working in public education for 12 years she felt that she could give back to future physical education and health educators.

She teaches physical education and health classes because physical activity and the knowledge of health has become such an important part of children in school. The subject is one that children in schools can take and use for a lifetime. Sharing this passion with future physical educators is important because good educators are needed now more than ever. She believes that relationships are the most important building blocks in education, and she will encourage future physical educators to share their passion with their future students.

Nicole and her husband, Edson, both played soccer at Graceland. They continue to coach and play soccer. She has two boys that both play club soccer in Kansas City.
