Save Your Spot for Fall 2025 on the Lamoni Campus

We believe in promoting passions and enjoying life both in and out of the classroom. In fact, we believe that being a part of a community and finding a sense of belonging are important aspects of your Graceland education, so we make sure to have plenty of opportunities for students to get involved on campus.
