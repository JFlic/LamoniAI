- Request a federal FSA ID, which is your signature. Students and parents will both need a federal FSA ID, and each need unique email addresses.
- Return to theFAFSAwebsite to enter your information.Remember to enter Graceland University’s school code: 001866.
- For the 2025-26 FAFSA year, you will use your 2023 taxes.
- If you have done your taxes before filling out your FAFSA, we strongly encourage you to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT). The IRS DRT allows your IRS tax information to be transmitted to your FAFSA, eliminating mistakes. You may be able to use the tool if you filed your taxes electronically at least two weeks before filing your FAFSA or if you filed on paper at least eight weeks prior.
- Authenticate your FAFSA by providing your FSA ID for both student and parent. Dependent students that fail to have a parent sign their FAFSA will result in an incomplete FAFSA. Only one parent is required to sign the FAFSA with an FSA ID.
- Should your FAFSA be required to complete the federal verification process, you will be notified via the email entered on the FAFSA. It is important to provide the documents needed to Student Financial Services within 30 days to complete this process and ensure you receive the financial aid for which you may be eligible.
