Graceland’sDecember Commencementwas held Saturday, Dec. 16, 2017, at the Community of Christ Auditorium in Independence, Missouri. Dr. Stassi Cramm offered the commencement address. Cramm is on the Graceland Board of Trustees and is the presiding bishop and member of the First Presidency for Community of Christ.

The Lamoni graduation ceremonies began Saturday, April 28 with thebaccalaureateservice. Board of Trustees member Laurie Heinz ’85 offered an inspiring message:

“Through giving of yourself to others, you lose your own burdens. Together, you (graduates) have a significantvoice that can change our world.”

Following baccalaureate, areception with President Patricia Draves and Dr. Jeff Draveswas held for the graduates in the beautiful Shaw Lobby. Later that evening, the19th annual candlelighting ceremonywas held on the brick plaza, where three students spoke of their Graceland memories.

TheSpring Commencement convocationbegan Sunday, April 29 with a ceremonious processional and a welcome from President Draves and several graduates in their native language. It was a day of firsts — the first spring commencement for President Draves; the firstcommencement address given by Drs. Matthew Bolton ’01 and Emily Welty; first duo address for Graceland graduates to hear; first spring commencement for Michele Black ’81 as Alumni Board Chair; and for many graduates, they were the first in their families to receive a college degree.

In their commencement address, Welty and Bolton encouraged the candidates to live an authentic life — to be passionately curious about the world. Welty challenged, “Know the thing that is definitively and undeniably ‘you,’ and do not betray that thing.” Bolton shared his memories of his time at Graceland and said, “This place nurtured me, and I was challenged. Go in peace now Gracelanders; show us what is possible.”

He is an expert on global peace and security policy with a focus on disarmament and humanitarianism.

He served in the Iowa State Senate, was elected as Senate President, and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996. As a member of Congress, education was of special concern to Boswell as he worked to provide students with the means needed to continue their education and strive for a better future. He served on the Graceland University Board of Trustees from 1990 - 2014, which included time as chairman of the Business and Administrative Services Committee.

Jeri Sindt, MSN, Associate Professor of Nursing, demonstrates the hard work and sacrifice that Graceland’s instructors make to continue in their calling as teachers. Her superior preparation and commitment to teaching has been a significant component of her students’ success. “She went above and beyond in my methods class to help me improve as a nursing student,” said one of her recent students.

Professor of EducationMichele Dickey-Kotz, PhD, is a passionate teacher driven by the belief that it is her responsibility to promote, provoke or inspire those around her to become the very best version of themselves. Dickey-Kotz models a dedication to teaching for both her students and her colleagues. “She sees the capacity for a student to grow into a teacher,” commented one of her students. “She believed in who I could become, and that has made all the difference.” Her dedication to the art of teaching and to her students earned her the prestigious award.

Raquel Moreira, PhD, Assistant Professor of Communication, was awarded the Organization for Research on Women and Communication’s Feminist Scholar of the Year Award Feb. 17. The award is given annually to recognize the best article published in the organization’s peer-reviewed journal,Women’s Studies in Communication, during the past year. Moreira’s article explores the importance of embodied politics for marginalized women as a point of entry to instigate structural changes in sexist, racist and classist contexts.

Dan Platt, PhD, Assistant Professor of English, served on several university committees, including the innovation committee, budget committee and faculty compensation committee, and he took the lead on professional development for Graceland’s learning-management system. Platt was integral to Graceland’s award of the Campus Kitchens grant, a $5,000 grant to address issues of hunger and food waste on campus and in the Lamoni community. He shouldered much of the work for Graceland to host the Midwest Honors Conference, which included 17 universities on the Lamoni campus.
