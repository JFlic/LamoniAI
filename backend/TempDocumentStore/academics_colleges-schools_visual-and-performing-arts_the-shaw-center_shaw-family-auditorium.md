# Shaw Family Auditorium

Preserving a Remarkable Space

An integral part of the original Shaw Center, the Shaw Auditorium has been a center for student life since 1982. With seating for over 500, the auditorium continues to host countless homecoming plays, baccalaureate ceremonies and Campus Organization for Social Activities (COSA) events.

This remarkable space enjoyed several enhancements during the Shaw renovations while preserving some of its most special features. The space is home to an impressive 23-rank organ. Seating in the auditorium was also preserved, with Graceland’s music faculty praising the space’s unique acoustic elements.

An upgrade of technology, redesign of lighting and sound systems, and renovation of the orchestra pit gives theatre productions more staging capabilities. The openness of the auditorium makes the space more intimate.

Student performers benefit from the green room backstage where they gather before performances. With a portable wall for use in this space, the large room becomes multi-purpose.

The Shaw Auditorium remains one of the largest spaces on campus where students can gather and enjoy the fine arts. With the Shaw bringing in renown talents like Arliss Howard, Jens Lindemann and the Fountain City Brass Band, this space will remain full of anxious spectators throughout the years.

“With these facilities, we have the access to bring in some really high-caliber performers to entertain and educate us,” said Gary Heisserer, associate dean of Academic Affairs.
