You’ve got questions – we’ve got answers.

Graceland staff applied for and receivedHigher Education Emergency Relief Fundsfrom the Department of Education.

Graceland signed and returned the U.S. Department of Education Certification and Agreement in 2020 and confirms that Graceland will use no less than 50% of the funds received under section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act to provide emergency financial aid grants to students.

To be considered for funding, students needed to apply. An online application form was posted on the internal website and advertised via emails to eligible students. Students were asked to identify the COVID related impact and identify if Graceland was authorized to apply any amount of grant dollars directly to their student account. Grants were made available via direct deposit or check.

Graceland staff continue to develop processes by which the remaining funds will be awarded. These numbers have been updated on July 8, 2020; Aug. 22, 2020; Oct. 29, 2020; Jan. 27, 2021; April 9, 2021; July 10, 2021; October 7, 2021; and April 15, 2022.
