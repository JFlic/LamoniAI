Briggs Hall

Talia started in Admissions in November 2000 as temporary support and was soon hired full-time as Admissions Specialist, later taking on the Admissions Office Manager Role.

In 2006, Talia earned her Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies from GU. She transitioned to IT as the Reporting Specialist from 2007 to 2010 to coordinate an upgrade for the institutional data reporting tool. In 2010, she returned to Enrollment as Director of Enrollment Operations overseeing both admissions and financial aid operations. In 2014, Graceland merged Financial Aid and Student Accounts to form Student Financial Services.

Talia has attended and presented at Jenzabar Annual Meetings and attended several financial aid conferences and trainings. She has assisted with Higher Learning Commission visit planning, led a Department of Education Financial Aid Program Review, and trained and mentored numerous operational staff along the way.

In 2019, Talia earned her Master of Education in Instructional Leadership from Graceland University. In 2010 and again in 2019, she served as Interim VP for Enrollment Management while new leaders were located. In 2020, she took on a new challenge as Chief Information Officer overseeing Information Technology, Student Financial Services, and Center for Graduate & Continuing Students.

Over 20 years of employment at Graceland, Talia has reported to 13 different supervisors and moved offices more than 10 times, so she consider herself agile and adaptable; having a growth mindset; working to be a change agent; and dedicating herself to being efficient and fiscally responsible.

I have developed some great relationships with students who I have been able to assist with financial planning and enjoy watching students earn their degree after putting in years of educational work. I enjoy the people I have had the honor to work with who are each impacting the lives of students in their own way.
