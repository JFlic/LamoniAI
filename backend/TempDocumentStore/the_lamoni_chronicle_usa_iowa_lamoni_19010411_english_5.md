Indians  Plead Emotional Insanity as  Defense.

BELIEVERS IN WITCHCRAFT.

Choctaw*  at  1'j.rU,  T u u , Are  Accn.ed of  Sluylnx  Two  Women  and  a  ManTribe  Divided  Over th* Crime  and Fata  Deterred.

Paris,  Tex.,  April  8 -Soloman  Hotema  and Sam Frye, full-blooded Choctow  Indians,  known as the  "witch, killers,'  were  arraigned  in  the  feder­ al  court  here  charged  with  murder. Sam  Tarnatubby,  an alleged witcli doctor,  jointly  indicted  with  them,  was granted  a  severance. The  defendants are  charged  with  the  murder  ot  two women  and  a  man,  all  Choctaws,  near Grant,  I.  T.,  on  April  14,  1899.

The  crims  was  due  to  a  belief  in witchcraft. There  had  been  several sudden  deaths  in  the  community  from meningitis. Tarnatubby  was  consult­ ed. He  stated  that  the  persons  had been  bewitched,  and  located  the  vic­ tims  of  the  defendants  as  the  witches who  had  worked  the  evil  charm,  de­ claring  they  would  have  to  be  killed to  stay  the  plague.

Hotoma  got  into  his  buggy,  and,  ac­ companied  by  Frye  and  Tobias  W ill­ iams,  who  afterwards  died  in  jail  at Atoka,  made  the  rounds  and  executed the  witches. The  slayers  were  a rre st­ ed,  and  granted  a  change  of  venue  to the  Paris  federal  court. The prisoners are  represented  by  able  counsel.  Their defense  Is  emotional  insanity.

Several  physicians  have  been  sum­ moned  to  give  expert  testimony,  and nearly  200  other  witnesses  have  been summoned.  The  trial  will la3t  four  or live  days. Great  bitterness  is  m ani­ fested  towards  the  defendants  by  the witnesses  from  the  scene  of  the  crime, especially  Hotema. The plea of  insan­ ity  is  expected  to  bring  out  some  in­ teresting  arguments  and facts con­ cerning  the  race  proclivities  and  re ligious  fanaticism   prompting  the  deed. The  afternoon's  proceedings  were  de­ voted  to  the  facts  of  the  killing.

Regarding  the  plea  of  insanity,  tli9 government  contends  that  the  belief in  w itchcraft  was  possessed  by  the  de­ fendants  and  their  neighbors;  that  in­ sanity  is  a  disease  of  the  mind,  and simply  a  conclusion  arrived  at  after Jnvestigation  and  argument. The  de­ fense  contends  that  Hotema  preached against  witchcraft  until ho became worked  up  into a religious frenzy, and  believed  he  was  commanded  by God  to  kill  the  alleged  witches.

## l ' r l d a y , April  5.

The  senate  killed  by  a  close  vote  the proposed  constitutional  amendment  per­ mitting  the  use  of  \oting  machines,  and advanced  one  stage  Senator  Stout's  bill forbidding marriage  of people  with  hered­ itary  diseases Something  In  the  nature of  a  lest  vote  on  the  primary  election  bill was  had  when,  by  a  vote  of  IS  to  13,  the senate  ordered  Senator  Miller's  duplicate of  tho  house  measure  back  from  the  com­ mittee  at  once  in  order  to  get  it  out  of the  way  before  the  house  bill,  now  be­ fore  tlie  upper  house,  is  taken  for  final disposition  next  Wednesday Apparently the  primary  measure  is  doomed. The house  passed  the  barbers'  license  bill  and gave  New  Ttlehmond  tlie  $21,000  borrowed from  the  state  at  the  lime  of  the  tor­ nado Another  measure passed  makes  the administering  of  narcotics  for  wrongfu purposes  u  felony.

## Coatljr  Ilia7.e  In  D olrolt.

Detroit,  April  8.-One  of  the  two large  plants  of  the  American  Radiator company,  located  just  outside  of  the city  lim its,  was  partially  destroyed  by fire. In  two  hours  the  warehouse,  the pattern  shop  and  the  machine  shop were  in  ruins. Frederick  W.  Hodges, manager of the  company, estimated  the loss  at  $150,000  and  said  it  was  fully covered  by  insurance.  Between  500  and 600  men  will  be  temporarily  thrown out  of  employment. The  cause  of  the fire  is  unknown. The  foundry  alone was  saved. The  two  Detroit  plants were  a  part  of  the  Radiator  combine, whose  headquarters  is  In  Chicago.

## Steamer  Hope  n  Total  Lo<r.

St.  Johns,  N.  F.,  April  8.-On  Sun­ day  the  sealing  steam er  Hope  was  lost on  Bryon  Island,  in  the  Gulf  of  St. Lawrence.  By  an  icefloe,  in  which  she was  frozen,  she  was  carried  over  a rocky  ledge,  her  bottom  being  chafed out  on  the  jagged  points  of  the  rocks. Her  entire  crew,  208  men,  escaped And  reached  the  land,  where  they  en­ dured keen privations until today when  the  scaler  Panther,  a  sister  ship, was sighted and  subsequently  em­ barked  them.

The  Hope  had  5.000  seals  on  board with  good  prosprcts  of  a  full  cargo. There  is  r..i  hope  of  saving  her.

A  MUsourlnn  Pronounces  on  the  Farm­

Just  at  present  considerable  interest Is  being  aroused  in  th e  fact  th a t  a  few new  districts  (of  lim ited  acreage)  are being opened out  by  the Canadian  gov­ ernment  in  Saskatchewan  and  Asslnibola  (western  Canada),  and  any  infor­ mation concerning th is   country is eagerly  sought.  Mr.  W.  R.  Corser,  ot Iiigginsville,  Lafayette  Co.,  Mo.,  was  a delegate  there  during last  summer, and writing  of  his  im pressions  he  says:

'I  found  surprising  yields  of  grain of  all  descriptions. One  farm er  I  vis­ ited  threshed  of  175  acres:

'600  bushels  of  w heat  from  fifteen acres,  40  bushels  to  acre.

'C00  bushels of barley from  ten acres,  60  bushels  to  acre.

'15,000  bushels of oats from  150 acres,  100  bushels  to  acre.

'The  samples  were  all  No.  1.

'I  also  sawr a  considerable  num ber  ot stock. Swine  do  well  and  there  is  no disease  amongst  them. They  are  a good  source  of  Income  to  the  farmer. The  cattle  on  the  range  beat  anything I  ever  saw. Fat  and  ready  for  beef, fully  m atured  and  ripened  on  the  nu­ tritious  grasses  of  the  prairie. I  am firmly  convinced  th a t  this  country  of­ fers  better  facilities  for  a  poor  man than  any  I  have  ever  seen.'

Information  concerning  these  lands can  be  had  from  any  agent of  the  gov­ ernment  whoso  advertisem ent  appears elsewhere  in  this  paper.

When you're offered something''just as good', it's  because  there  is  a  little  more  money in  the  fake. Buy CASCARETS from the  honest dealer. They are  always  put  up  in  blue  metal  boxes  with  long-tailed  trademarked C on the cover- every tablet  stamped  C. C. C.,  and  they are never sold in  bulk. Remember this and when­ ever fakes  are  offered  when  C ASCARETS  are  called  for,  get  all  the  details  and  write  us  on  the  subject  at  once.
