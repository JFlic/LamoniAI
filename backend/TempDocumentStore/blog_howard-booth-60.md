### 

Known for his sharp wit, deep compassion, and unflagging dedication to education, his influence rippled far beyond the classroom.

Born in Detroit, Michigan, Booth felt the call to faith early, ordained into the RLDS (now Community of Christ) priesthood at just 16 years old. After earning his bachelor’s degree in religion at Graceland, he began his career as a staff assistant at the church’s World Headquarters. Driven by his passion for theology and education, he earned his master’s in counseling from UMKC and his PhD in religion from the University of Iowa, becoming a trailblazer in both faith and academia.

Booth joined Graceland’s faculty in 1969, embarking on a 31-year career that reshaped the university’s academic landscape. He played a central role in the creation of groundbreaking programs such as Winter Term, liberal studies, the experimental curriculum, and the peace studies minor. Beyond these initiatives, he led the Religion and Philosophy Department and later served as the inaugural chair of the Humanities Division. His scholarship extended to his church, where he wrote extensively on religion and theology, including a landmark biography of Edwin Diller Starbuck.

But Booth wasn’t just known for his academic achievements; he was the embodiment of community and joy. Ray Adams ’69 recalls Howard’s turn as the bass in the staff quartet “The Unpredictables.” Despite being better suited to sing baritone, Howard cheerfully gave his best to the role, but the pitch adjustments made their arrangements too high for their tenor, Jerry Hampton. “Howard, being the empathetic soul that he was,” Adams remembers, “understood the difficulty for Jerry, and suggested it might be better if he returned to the role of fan and that the group look for another bass.” It was a quintessential Howard moment: always game to try something new and deeply empathetic to those around him.

Booth’s warmth extended far beyond performances or lectures. He was a storyteller, a mentor, and a global traveler, exploring over 65 countries with Bonita and often bringing students along to witness the world’s beauty. Known for his laugh and his legendary spaghetti sauce, he brought energy and humor to every setting.

While his passing marks the end of an era, his legacy remains alive in the hearts and minds of all who knew him. The programs he helped create, the students he inspired, and the friendships he cherished will continue to honor the life of a man who truly made Graceland a better place.

Graceland sends heartfelt condolences to Bonita, Gevin, Darin, and the extended Booth family. We will carry his light forward, with gratitude for the profound ways he shaped our community.
