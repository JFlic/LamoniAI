Embark on a journey in health and movement with Graceland’s Pre- Athletic Trainer education and chiropractic degree.

This track within Graceland's allied health program is designed to prepare students for athletic training and chiropractic graduate schools. Upon graduation, students will have an in-depth understanding of biomechanics, functional anatomy, nutrition, and movement science. You'll become well-versed in movement health science and leave with the tools needed to excel in any graduate programs at Graceland or otherwise.Chiropractors care for patients with health problems in the neuromusculoskeletal system, and athletic trainers offer injury prevention and rehabilitation, wellness promotion, and emergent care services. Both professions leave on movement health science to understand human anatomy and movement. Graceland's athletic trainer degree and chiropractic degree are the place to start if you're interested in either of those two professions.
