Homecoming is a time for reconnection, reflection, and celebration, and for those who attended, the event provided an opportunity to make new memories with one another. Without a doubt, the Graceland Experience was in full effect for an unforgettable festival-style weekend.

The theme this year was Be Bold, Be Bright, and the Graceland community did not disappoint. On Friday night, several alumni were recognized for various awards, and some were immortalized in the Yellowjacket Hall of Fame (see p8). Air Band returned for the first time in several years, allowing alumni and friends to experience the newly renovated interior of Morden Center. The excitement in the air was palpable as everyone cheered on their favorite performances.

On Saturday, Head Football Coach Patrick Ross inspired those gathered for the Yellowjacket Pep Rally, while the Graceland Spirit Squad – the drumline, cheerleaders, and Gadets dance team – electrified the crowd. The football, men’s soccer, and women’s soccer teams all put together encouraging performances in front of the Yellowjacket faithful. Honor classes were celebrated on Saturday night which brought a feeling of nostalgia for those who participated. Food trucks and music concluded the evening with offerings from KB’s Island Flava, Hawaiian Grill Food Truck, Little Green Trailer, and Lolo Snow.

Alumni and friends were also treated to the Homecoming production, “The Play That Goes Wrong.” This hilarious hybrid of Monty Python and Sherlock Holmes was heavily lauded by the Graceland community. Both the Music Showcase — featuring the Graceland University Symphonic Band, Concert Choir, Chamber Choir, Harmonium, and Orchestra — and the Ergo and Friends recital brought a sense of revelry to the weekend.

On Sunday morning, former Graceland Campus Minister and newly-appointed Community of Christ Apostle Shandra Newcom ’90, provided the morning message, and Graceland Harmonium helped conclude Homecoming with their beautiful ministry of music.
