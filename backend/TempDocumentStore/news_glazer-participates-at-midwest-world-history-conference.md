October 12, 2023 | jns

Social Sciences Department Chair and Professor of HistorySteven Glazer, PhD, participated in the 13th Annual Conference of the Midwest World History Association (MW-WHA), held this year at Roosevelt University in downtown Chicago.

Under the themeOutcasts, Pariahs, and Criminals: Histories of Others and Othering, the conference explored how world historians at all levels – high school, community college, or university – can best create spaces for exploring, sharing, teaching and learning about contested topics.

Glazer contributed to a panel onExperiential Teaching beyond the Classroomwith his presentation on a 2017 summer session that took Graceland University students and faculty to the UK. The group visited places such as London and Dunfield House that provided context to their respective History, Art, Music, and Film courses, among which Prof. Glazer led a class onWe Shall Never Surrender: Britain’s Role in World War II.

At the Chicago conference, Glazer further attended panels on topics such asZoroastrians and Accommodation in Early Islamic History,Teaching Empires and their Dissolution, and The Conflict between KemalismandRacism in the Early Turkish Republic, 1922-1945. He learned about the largest collection of Haitian art located at the Milwaukee Art Museum and joined conference colleagues in exploring the delights of deep-dish pizza.

Glazer serves on the Executive Committee of the MW-WHA and was on the conference planning committee for this year’s meeting.

TheMidwest World History Associationpromotes the study of world history through the encouragement of research, teaching, and publication. It offers activities and exchange platforms to increase historical awareness, understanding among and between peoples, and global consciousness.
