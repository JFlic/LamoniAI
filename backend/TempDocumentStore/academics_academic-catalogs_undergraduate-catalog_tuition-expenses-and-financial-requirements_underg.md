Fees and charges are considered late if not paid on or before the program start date of each term. Financial Clearance (payment of the balance due or approved payment arrangements) must be completed by the program start date of each term. Failure to be financially cleared by the program start date may result in the assessment of a $200.00 Late Financial Clearance Fee. Continued failure to become financially cleared or to maintain payment arrangements may result in registration suspension; registration cancellation; withdrawal from the university; and withholding of a transcript, grade, or degree.

Fall semester due date is August 1

Spring semester due date is January 2

Full payment or participation in an approved payment plan is required on or before the first day of class. A penalty may be assessed for late arrangements. If you fail to be financially cleared, you risk being dropped from enrollment and possible institutional withdrawal. Accounts that become past due will be assigned an accounts receivable hold, which will prohibit changes in registration and/or release of transcripts.

Graceland University is pleased to offer a payment plan allowing a monthly payment schedule. Plans are interest free and are assessed a non-refundable processing fee of $50.00 for plans 3 months or longer. Students or parents interested in a payment plan should contact the office of Student Financial Services.

Registration as a student at Graceland University signifies the student’s agreement to do the following:

(table of contents)

Balance of funds in excess of charges created by financial aid will be paid directly to the student (with the exception of Parent Plus Loans which will be payable to the parent). These funds are available to the student for use in paying non-Graceland costs such as books, off-campus housing, personal expenses and transportation.

Graceland University students not returning to Graceland for the next term, including GRADUATES and students who leave during a term, are required to initiate the withdrawal process. Lamoni Campus students must formally notify the Retention Office of their intent to withdraw. Independence Campus students, Off-Campus Program students or Global Campus students must formally notify their Site Coordinator or Program Consultant of their intent to withdraw. Non-attendance does not constitute withdrawal notification. The last date of attendance is used to determine financial aid award adjustments and calculate refunds for mid-semester withdrawals as per the Refund Policy. When Official Notification is not provided by the student, the date the university determines the student needs to be withdrawn is used as the notification date.

(table of contents)

Graceland University’s Refund Policy follows the Federal Return of Title IV Aid Refund Policy to determine return of financial aid and to calculate refunds for withdrawals. Calculations use the notification date to pro-rate aid as well as tuition and refundable charges through the 60 percent point in the semester, based on calendar days from the first day of the semester through the last scheduled day of the semester, including weekends and mid-semester breaks of less than five days. After the 60 percent point in the semester, financial aid will not be reduced for any withdrawal, nor will any refund will be granted. This policy applies to all university withdrawals whether student initiated or administrative withdrawals.

Financial aid awarded (if any) will be returned to the federal, state and Graceland programs on a pro rata basis through the 60 percent point in the semester. Outside scholarship or non-federal loan assistance will not be returned unless specifically requested by the provider.

Eligible charges due or paid will be refunded on a pro rata basis through the 60 percent point in the semester. Some fees are non-refundable and therefore not pro-rated. If a student living on campus withdraws from housing (but not from school) anytime after the first week of the semester, the semester charge for housing remains assessed in full. Board charges will be pro-rated. Refunds are processed within 45 days of withdrawal. Students should note that withdrawal may or may not result in an actual refund of money to the student. Circumstances may occur in which the student still owes money to the University even after appropriate withdrawal credit.

Contact Student Financial Services with specific questions.

Graceland University students may withdraw from a course through the 13 percent point of the semester without a “WD” grade. A grade of “WD” is recorded in any course when the student withdraws after the 13 percent point and through the 60 percent point of the semester. After 60 percent of the semester is complete, the student is not allowed to withdraw from the course, and will be awarded the appropriate grade in the course. Please refer to the Class Attendance Policy regarding Course Withdrawal by Instructor and Administrative Withdrawals.

Course withdrawals must be initiated by students.  Non-attendance does not constitute withdrawal notification. Notification dates are used to calculate withdrawal credit and financial aid award adjustments for mid-semester withdrawals as per the Refund Policy. When Official Notification is not provided by the student, the date the university determines the student needs to be withdrawn is used as the notification date.

Contact your Program Consultant, Site Coordinator or the Registrar’s Office with specific questions.

Financial aid awards will be re-evaluated as appropriate for course withdrawals or changes in enrollment status. Refunds for course withdrawals will follow the pro rata schedule used for university withdrawals as per the Refund Policy. Exceptions to the pro rata schedule for course withdrawal are:

## Return of Institutional Deposit

Failure to initiate the withdrawal process or complete the checkout process (if applicable) may result in the forfeiture of the institutional deposit. Following withdrawal from the university, return of the institutional deposit balance, net of any outstanding charges, will be mailed to the student’s home address as soon as processing can be completed following the end of the semester or term.
