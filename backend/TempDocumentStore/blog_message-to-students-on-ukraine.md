The following message was sent to our students via email:

Dear students,

The news we have seen coming out of Ukraine is unsettling. As a university, we hold as one of our core values the wholeness of our students and graduates and threats of violence and war directly impact the health and wellness of the Ukrainian people and their families and friends.

Over the years, many Ukrainian students have attended Graceland; we led the way in the early 1990s as the first American university to welcome students from other Baltic countries, including Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. Our graduates are brave leaders and difference-makers who have a deep desire to spark the positive social changes so desperately needed in our society and around the world.

We join the prayers for peace offered by people around the world. We encourage the leaders of the countries involved both directly and indirectly to pursue a swift and peaceful resolution to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

This university and our students are resilient. I have watched such amazing creativity and perseverance through the pandemic and I know that our community always bands together to support each other – students, faculty, and staff alike. If this crisis prompts difficult memories or feelings, know that you have our support. The caring community at Graceland is here for you; Lamoni students, do not hesitate to reach out to Dee White Eye, our counselor, or to anyone on campus that you may feel close to – we are here for you. Independence and online students, we have resources for you as well. Do not hesitate to reach out to faculty and staff, who can direct you to what you need.

I ask that all of you please join me in praying for those affected by this crisis.
