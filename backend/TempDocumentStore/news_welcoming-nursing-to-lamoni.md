December 20, 2024 | Shane Adams

Graceland University is proud to announce the launch of a newBachelor of Science in Nursing(BSN) program on itsLamoni campus, set to begin in the fall of 2025. This expansion continues Graceland’s legacy of excellence in nursing education, established through its long-standing program at the Independence, Missouri, campus.Applicationsare now being accepted for the Lamoni program.

The new BSN program will provide Graceland students the opportunity to complete their entire nursing degree on the Lamoni campus while enjoying the full undergraduate experience, including the ability to participate in sports throughout all four years of study. This addition also responds to a growing demand from students who have consistently ranked nursing as one of the most requested programs in Lamoni.

“Expanding our nursing program to Lamoni builds on Graceland’s enduring tradition of preparing exceptional nurses who make a difference in their communities,” said Graceland President Joel Shrock, PhD. “This move represents our commitment to meeting student needs and advancing rural health care—two areas central to our mission.”

With full program approval and secured clinical sites, Graceland is poised to offer a high-quality educational experience that prepares graduates for success in their careers. Dr. Sharon Little-Stoetzel, Dean of theSchool of Nursing, shared, “We are thrilled to bring this program to Lamoni. The dedicated faculty and outstanding facilities that have been the hallmark of our Independence program will now be mirrored in Lamoni, creating a seamless experience across both campuses.”

The Lamoni program will be led by Dr. Kathleen Paco Cadman, a Graceland alumna with expertise in rural health. “Having someone with Dr. Cadman’s passion and experience at the helm of this program is key to helping us support future nurses and serve the surrounding community,” added Dr. Little-Stoetzel.

Students on the Lamoni campus will have the unique opportunity to major in nursing while also receiving a second major in Transformational Leadership, the University’s innovative approach to the liberal arts, which prepares students with the durable skills they need throughout their lives. Graceland has worked for over a year to bring this program to life, driven by its belief in fostering opportunities for students to succeed academically and personally while addressing the vital need for skilled nurses across rural Iowa and beyond.
