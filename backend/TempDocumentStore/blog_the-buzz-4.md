From new programs to all things student life, there are so many cool things happening throughout the year!

April 14, 2022 | Georgia Seagraves

Associate Professor of English Cat Clifford started theGRACELAND BOOK CLUBin 2017 because she wanted to read 1984 by George Orwell and she wasn’t alone. Soon she had a group of students and faculty who gathered to foster community and celebrate the love of reading.

Book Club discusses books (usually novels) that the group decides to read. Last year’s selections ranged from “new classic” fantasy and dystopian novels like Octavia Butler’s Kindred and Dawn to Colson Whitehead’s recent award-winning novel The Nickel Boys. Students, staff, faculty and community members are welcome to join anytime and there is a strict “no guilt” policy — that is, members are encouraged to read if they can but not to feel guilty if they can’t!

Here are some of the books alumni shared with us on social media back in the summer, along with a couple selections ourHorizonsteam read recently.

While student attendance has ebbed and flowed at Graceland sporting events, this year’s Graceland Student Government (GSG) was determined to make it thrive. “We recognized that while we have so many student-athletes on campus, we were lacking school spirit at those events, and we wanted to find a way to support them,” said GSG president Casey Main ’22 (pictured front row, the one wearing floaties). From this initiative, coupled with the students’ desire to have aSTUDENT SECTION, the “Stingdom” was born. The new student section can be seen attending sporting events with exciting themes like beach day, gold out, and jersey night.

The past few years have shifted and changed many paradigms while also challenging social and religious institutions. With a desire to change the world, the Community of Christ Seminary now offers aMASTER OF ARTS IN PEACE AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATIONfor those who wish to explore the intersection of faith and action and how it can be applied in everyday life. The goal of this program is to spark important conversations around justice by combining spiritual formation, theological literacy, civic engagement, local ministry context, and innovative methods of social change and transformation.

Graceland sponsored theKANSAS CITY ROYALS NURSE APPRECIATION NIGHTon June 15, 2021, as a special event to honor the hard work, strong commitment, anddedication of all nurses. Alumni, Graceland nurses, and Royals fans gathered together at Kauffman Stadium to celebrate the incredible sacrifice healthcare workers have made during the COVID-19 pandemic. Graceland gave out “Gutsy Nurses” shirts, hand sanitizer, shopping bags and even had two Gracelanders — Katie Bruels ’18 and Patrick Kirk ’19 — throw and catch the honorary first pitch.

Mark your calendars and join us at the K for our next Nurses Night on May 20, 2022.

Just before Nedd and Vincent returned to Guyana to start training ahead of the February matches, Graceland hosted a send-off party to celebrate their achievement.

Since 1961, thousands of students have enjoyed community meals in the Floyd M. McDowell Commons. To make the experience even better, Graceland partnered with Sodexo in August of 1998 provide excellent food service to students on the Lamoni campus. This past summer, Graceland renewed their contract with Sodexo began an exciting new project to provide the Commons and the Swarm with a major upgrade. It was not just new paint and new finishings – the Commons received new seating including a variety of styles like booths and high-tops, an allergen-free station, plant-based options, and improved energy efficiency.
