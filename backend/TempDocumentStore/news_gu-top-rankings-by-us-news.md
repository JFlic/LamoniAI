LAMONI, IOWA (January 15, 2013)—For the second year in a row, Graceland University was ranked in the top 20 Best Online Education Programs in the country by the U.S. News & World Report’s annual rankings edition of the Best Online Education Programs.

Released today, Graceland Online Education Programs’ rankings are:

For the first time, programs administered for distance learners that are 100 percent online were ranked numerically, just like traditional colleges and graduate schools. Online bachelor’s degree programs as well as graduate online degree programs in business, engineering, nursing, education, and computer information technology were ranked.

“Online education allows people to attend school without having to quit their jobs or disrupt their lives. According to Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce, people with a bachelor’s degree earn 84 percent more than those with only a high school diploma in their lifetimes—making online education, with its flexibility, an increasingly popular option. This is why online education is becoming an essential part of Graceland’s education,” said Graceland University President John Sellars.

Online bachelor’s degree programs were ranked in three different categories: student engagement, faculty credentials and training, and student services and technology. All of the online master’s degree programs were ranked in admissions selectivity in addition to the bachelor’s degree categories. The engineering and business master’s programs were also ranked based on ratings of their academic reputation by top academics who run online programs at peer institutions.
