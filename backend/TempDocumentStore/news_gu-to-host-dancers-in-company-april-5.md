About Dancers In Company

Dancers In Company is the touring repertory dance company of the Department of Dance at The University of Iowa. The company of twelve dancers, undergraduates and graduate students, tours throughout Iowa and the Midwest from March to June each year performing live concerts and lecture demonstrations for audiences of all ages. A variance of dance styles are presented by the company, including contemporary dance, jazz dance and classical ballet.

The company was formed in 1984, when program director Judy Allen with the Dance faculty and Mary Louise Plautz, who directed the Arts Education Outreach program, recognized the great need to bring live dance performances to Iowa audiences. The company has, since its inception, brought dance performances to many communities where a live dance concert is a rarity.

The vibrant company has performed in eight states taking the company to the UDLA-Puebla, México, the Arts Institute in Chicago and the 1990 International Dance Festival in Hong Kong. The company has toured to numerous cities, including Chicago, Tucson, Wichita, Omaha, Milwaukee, St. Louis and Kansas City.
