May 12, 2020

Graceland University President Patricia H. Draves announced that the university intends to return to on-campus instruction for the Fall 2020 Semester for its Lamoni and in-person Independence programs, subject to federal and local public health guidelines.

“I am extremely proud of the way that our students, faculty, and staff have responded to this global pandemic, continuing our community commitment to high-quality educational experiences and care for one another. Our expectation and hope for the fall is to welcome students back to both of our campuses.  We are already engaged in planning with the Iowa and Missouri health authorities for a safe, flexible, and strong academic year that puts the health and safety of our students and community as our top priority.

“While preparing to be together, we acknowledge that there will be some aspects of academic study and campus life that will be different than the past. Our faculty and staff have some great plans and new opportunities for students this fall.  We have also been in close discussion with the NAIA and the Heart of America Athletic Conference to determine the safest ways for our student athletes and fans to enjoy athletic competitions this year and are working together to provide safe, fun, and meaningful opportunities within the guidelines of the government and professional authorities.

“In the event that COVID-19 continues to disrupt us, we are also preparing alternative instruction models so students’ education will not be interrupted.  Remote experiences, changes to the academic calendar, and simplified, yet personalized, course schedules; all designed to protect everyone’s health, while prioritizing our highly engaged student community are all being developed in case they are needed.

“Graceland believes in The Power of Together and we will keep that to heart as we continue our preparations for the coming year, knowing that this is a fluid and dynamic environment. We will provide bi-weekly updates regarding the fall on the Graceland webpage.Please find all COVID-19-related information here.”
