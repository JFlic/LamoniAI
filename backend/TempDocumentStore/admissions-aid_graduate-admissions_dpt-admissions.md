The hybrid DPT program is available for qualified individuals who have a desire to continue their academic career in the field of physical therapy. This program targets both traditional and nontraditional students who demonstrate strong potential to navigate the rigorous accelerated, hybrid model curriculum. Acceptance into the program will be granted on a rolling basis.

We have two paths students can pursue to apply to the DPT program, traditional and early assurance. For more information on the early assurance path click the button here titled “early assurance”.

Register for a free informational webinar to learn more about what a hybrid, accelerated program can look like for you.

The program will require a broad spectrum of biological, physical, and behavioral science courses, as well as coursework in English composition to adequately prepare students for DPT graduate-level education. Prerequisite courses ensure that all students, regardless of academic major, have a basic knowledge and understanding of these foundational sciences. Additionally, standardized prerequisites provide the Admissions Committee with a consistent and equitable means to evaluate undergraduate performance and assess student readiness for DPT education. The following prerequisites are required:

*Introductory-level science courses are not accepted. Read full course descriptions below.

Note: Introductory-level science courses are not accepted.

The program will not grant transfer credits from another program or institution. All courses within the professional didactic and clinical curriculum are required. The program will only accept advanced placement courses towards direct equivalent prerequisites if the advanced placement credit was accepted by the applicant’s undergraduate institution.

The Technical Standards of Graceland University’s Doctor of Physical Therapy Program (non- academic prerequisites) define the essential functions that an applicant must be able to perform to be admitted to the DPT Program, to progress satisfactorily, and to graduate. Upon matriculation, students must attest to meeting the Technical Standards and Essential Functions of the physical therapist student.

Essential functions of the physical therapist student refer to all non-academic criteria that are necessary to participate in the educational program. These include basic motor and communication skills, intellectual abilities, behavioral and social attributes, and other requirements. Listed below are considered minimum abilities required in the educational process of a physical therapist. The integrity of the curriculum must be maintained, and those elements deemed essential to the education of a physical therapist must be required and completed.Find the full technical standards and essential functions.

Students are required to have a laptop computer and a mobile device in order to complete the online coursework.Find the full technology requirements.
