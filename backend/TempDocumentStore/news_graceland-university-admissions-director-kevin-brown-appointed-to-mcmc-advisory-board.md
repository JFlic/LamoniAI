February 19, 2016

Graceland University Director of Admissions, Kevin Brown, has been appointed by the Board of Regents to serve on the advisory board for the Multi-State Collaborative on Military Credit (MCMC). The group will also be working with Home Base Iowa (HBI).

Brown commented, “I welcome the opportunity to be a part of this committee and represent Graceland University on the state level as well. It will be an honor to collaborate with other institutions in working out steps to award credit to the many service members for their work for serving their country.”

In October 2014, Lumina Foundation awarded a $900,000 grant to Midwestern Higher Education Compact (MHEC), under which MCMC operates, to assist an interstate partnership of 13 states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin). The grant is being used to advance best practices designed to ease the transition of veterans and their families from military life to college campuses. It is the responsibility of MCMC to determine the amount and type of college credit to offer returning veterans for their military experience.

Home Base Iowa (HBI) is a program started by Governor Branstad in 2013 that is Iowa’s response to assist transitioning service members. Veterans Leonard Boswell, who serves on the Graceland University Board of Trustees, and Bob Meyers, Casey’s CEO, are co-chairs.

Graceland University President John Sellars states, “It is a nice recognition for Graceland to represent Iowa colleges and universities, and we are proud that Kevin Brown will be serving on the advisory board for MCMC.”
