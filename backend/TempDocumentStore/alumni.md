Once a Gracelander, always a Gracelander.

The bonds formed at Graceland don’t end with graduation. In fact, our goal is to help you keep the lifelong connections you made at Graceland alive through events, networking opportunities, volunteer activities and so much more.

Any student who completes 12 credit hours at any of our locations is considered a proud member of the Graceland University Alumni Association. There are no annual dues, though we welcome your generosity.

Join us for the annual public meeting, held every year on the Saturday of Homecoming. All members may pose questions and express concerns at this meeting.

Throw on your blue and gold, and join us in a walk down memory lane.

Come Graceland sons and daughters all,and join our happy throng.With loyal voices let us raiseour Alma Mater song.O hillcrest home of vision wide,where bonds of love hold sway.Where all may learn in life and lore’tis Thee we praise today.

Through memory a thread shall run,of golden richness made.Cementing there the treasures rarein thy foundation laid.O Alma Mater, guide us on,thy standard e’er unfoldAnd call us on with memoriesof days ‘neath the Blue and Gold.

Through years and decades long to comethy battlemented towerShall rise to call the youth of landsto answer to the hour.And while thy work shall carry on,our benisons are toldIn lives of honor, truth and right,the seal of the Blue and Gold.

—Roy A. Cheville, 1926

Graceland Forever, dear Alma MaterLong may she ever firm keep her stand.Her sons and daughters carry to othersHer fame throughout the land, Rah, rah, rah.Graceland, Graceland, we’re all for you,Strong, united, loyal and true.We’ll carry on ’til victory is won,Oh, Graceland, we’re all for you!

—Warren McElwain, 1925
