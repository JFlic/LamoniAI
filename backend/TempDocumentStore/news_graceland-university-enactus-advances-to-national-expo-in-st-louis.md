May 4, 2016

After a successful trip to the Rogers, Arkansas, Enactus Regional Competition in April, Graceland Enactus has qualified to compete at the Enactus National Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, on May 15, 16 and 17.

The Graceland Enactus presentation team will share a live media presentation of their projects to judges who represent leadership in businesses and nonprofits from some of the largest and most influential companies in the United States. Also presenting will be over 150 teams representing 2,400 students of other teams across the country that qualified in their regional competition to advance to the Expo.

The Graceland presentation team includes Karl Bradford, Sydney Dorrance, Drew Radloff, Melissa Sherer, Tara Sheehy and Courtney Brummett. Other team members in attendance will be project leaders and members who brainstorm, design and implement the project work that the Graceland team will present, as well as students who put together the audio-visual presentation and provide other logistical support.

Enactus is an international nonprofit organization that brings together student, academic and business leaders who are committed to using the power of entrepreneurial action to improve the quality of life and standard of living for people in need.
