LAMONI, IOWA (December 24, 2012)—The United States Air Force Heartland of America Band’s Brass in Blue, a pioneering symphonic brass ensemble, presented a free concert in the Shaw Center Family Auditorium at Graceland University on Feb. 11, 2013, at 7:30 p.m. The concert was free and open to the public.

This 13-piece brass, percussion and vocal ensemble presented a diverse and exciting program that had audiences agreeing the group is “once heard, never forgotten.”

Representing more than 325,000 Air Force professionals, Brass in Blue showcases the service’s excellence and precision in every performance. Comprised of ten brass players, one percussionist and a vocalist, the ensemble maintains a rigorous performance schedule presenting a diverse repertoire featuring orchestral transcriptions, patriotic favorites, jazz standards, new compositions and arrangements.

Frank Perez, Director of Bands at Graceland University, says: “Brass in Blue is a tremendous group of musicians as well as ambassadors. The concert is inspirational and extremely well performed. In addition, the time the audience gets to spend visiting with the band members after the performance adds a personal touch that they will not soon forget.”

Brass in Blue’s diversity and flexibility make it well-suited for all types of events and audiences. The group was selected to open the 2008 Grand Teton Music Festival, has performed the National Anthem for a Minnesota Timberwolves game, performs educational master classes for many Midwestern colleges, and regularly receives rave reviews from audiences across the Heartland.
