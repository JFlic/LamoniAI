When Congress abolished liquoV sell­ ing  in   th e   arm y   canteens  it  also  au­ thorized  th e  President  to  am end  the arm y ratio n   as  he  saw  fit,  th e change being to  enable him  to supply some of the  delicacies  th a t  the  soldiers  form ­ erly bought  for  themselves  out  of canteen  profits. The new ration now prescribed  by  Presidential  order,  in­ cludes th e  m ost  liberal  subsistence al­ lowed any soldiers in th e w orld, and  is adapted  to  the  tropical  conditions  as well a s  th e frozen  zone of A laska.
