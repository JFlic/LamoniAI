Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/blog/new-faces-on-the-board-2025/#top

February 12, 2025 | Georgia Seagraves, MS, ’21

These new trustees, selected through collaboration between the corporate body of Community of Christ and Graceland’s administration, bring diverse expertise from various industries. What unites them is their shared passion for Graceland and its students. TheHorizonsteam reached out to these new trustees to learn more about their motivations for joining the board and what excites them most about Graceland’s future.

STEPHANIE WINTERS McCONNELL, MS, ’95

Winters McConnell is a third-generation Graceland graduate and a lifelong member of the Community of Christ. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Graceland in 1995, she earned her master’s degree in Industrial/ Organizational Psychology from Emporia State University in 1997. She is a Marketing and Communications Managing Director for Accenture, leading a global team responsible for pursuit and reputation marketing.

“I am honored and humbled to join the Graceland Board of Trustees. Graceland played a significant role in my formative years, laying the foundation for my professional development and, more importantly, my leadership style and personal growth. The opportunities afforded to me as a student leader were instrumental in shaping me into who I am today and are a significant part of the Graceland Experience. I believe in Graceland’s mission, and as a board member, I look forward to helping Graceland thrive.”

JOHN R. WHITEHURST ’72

Tempered by the chilly winds of Des Moines and shaped by a loving family and the encouragement of of his Community of Christ congregation, Whitehurst began a two-year life-changing Graceland Experience as an art major. Later, accepting a scholarship to Drake University, Whitehurst began wearing many hats: artist, newspaper owner, pastor, sailor, investor, landlord, rancher, world traveler, and now Trustee of Graceland University.

“I am very honored to be asked to serve on the Board of Graceland University. I was an art major at Graceland. My life has been lived from the point of view of an artist. At some point in my early years, I realized that every act we do is, or at least can be, artistic. By that, I mean we can be creative in every endeavor. When we live life like that, we come up with new ways and ideas about everything in which we are involved. As creators, we can change literally everything, from the smallest acts to changing the world. I believe there is nothing more rewarding than inspiring another person to become whatever they choose to become, so that is why I chose to serve on the Board for Graceland University.”

JAMES “JAY” COOK III, MBA, ’79

Cook attended Graceland University for two years before earning a Bachelor of Science in Social Planning from Cornell and an MBA in Finance and Accounting from the University of Chicago. A seasoned finance executive, he has held leadership roles at Quaker, Sears, AutoZone, Lowe’s, and Belk. Jay serves as Bishop and CFO for the Community of Christ Mission Center in North Carolina and chairs the Onset Campground Board of Trustees.

“I am honored to join the Graceland University Board of Trustees and look forward to giving back to the university that has meant so much to me. My time at Graceland was transformative, and I am excited to contribute to its continued growth and success.”

The addition of these three accomplished individuals to Graceland’sBoard of Trusteesmarks an exciting and pivotal moment for the university. Winters McConnell, Whitehurst, and Cook bring diverse expertise, innovative leadership, and a shared passion for Graceland’s mission and students. Each trustee’s unique perspective and personal connection to Graceland reflect their deep commitment to supporting the university’s growth and long-term success. Their contributions will help shape a promising future for Graceland, fostering new opportunities for students and the broader community.

“Our new trustees joined an already gifted board and immediately began making substantive contributions that are positively impacting Graceland’s operations as a university. I am thrilled to welcome Stephanie, John, and Jay to the board because I know their passion for our mission and energy for our student experience will help us continue to advance our culture of radical belonging in all parts of our community.”

MICHAEL R. WILEY, PhD, ’83Chair, Graceland University Board of Trustees

Since joining the board, they have been busy — hiring new president Dr. Shrock, approving the newMaster’s in Business Administration (MBA)andWomen’s Wrestlingprograms, and helping improve Graceland’s processes using their career experience and love for the institution as a guide. TheAlumni Board of Directorsgot a similar infusion of energy with the election of John Godfrey, MA, ’06 as its new president (read his letterhere). Together, the Board of Trustees and Alumni Board play an important role in Graceland’s success and we warmly welcome their contributions and the invaluable impact they will offer.
