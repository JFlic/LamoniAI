Patricia Draves named President at Monmouth College. Graceland names Dr. Joel Shrock Interim President

March 27, 2024

Board of TrusteesChair Michael R. Wiley, PhD, announced Wednesday that Graceland President Patricia Draves, PhD, accepted the position of president at Monmouth College in Monmouth, Ill., and will leave Graceland this summer. Wiley also announced that the board of trustees namedJoel D. Shrock, PhD, to serve as Interim President.

The Draves’ family connection to Monmouth College goes back decades to when her husband, Dr. Jeff Draves, was a student. President Draves returned to serve as a member of the faculty in 2002, establishing the biochemistry program. And while they raised their family in the Monmouth community, the decision to return was still not one the Draves took lightly. “Jeff and I will always consider ourselves a part of the Graceland community,” she said. “Graceland alumni around the world took us in as one of their own and welcomed us in a way I did not expect. This is an extremely special place – a difficult one to leave – but I am proud of the work we have done, and I know that we have set the University on a course for success.”

Draves’ presidency began in 2017 and has been marked with pioneering ideas and large initiatives, particularly the rollout of the Blue, Gold & Bold Strategic Framework, which established a new academic model at the institution, awarding all undergraduate students asecond major in transformational leadership. Last year, the school announced it wastransforming its undergraduate tuitionfrom $32,500 to $19,950, making Graceland more accessible and affordable while retaining its commitment to a robust liberal arts education.

“President Draves’ service to Graceland over the past seven years has been exceptional,” said Wiley. “She showed herself to be an academic innovator while she became rooted in the Lamoni community and the Graceland network around the world. It has been my pleasure to serve on the board of trustees during her tenure, working side-by-side to fulfill the University’s mission.”

Draves also helped the University raise over $30 million for capital projects, including the complete renovations of Morden Center and Newcom Student Union. She also successfully guided the University through the global coronavirus pandemic, which placed immense strain on universities across the United States.

“President Draves’ impact on the future of Graceland students will be felt for a generation,” said Kristi Hettrick, Vice President for Institutional Advancement. “I returned to ‘the Hill’ to work with her on securing Graceland’s long-term success, and we have made great progress toward that goal. I have worked closely with Dr. Shrock on many initiatives and am confident our amazing students will continue to be our most important focus.”

The board of trustees named Vice President for Academic Affairs Joel D. Shrock, PhD, Interim President.Shrock joined Graceland as VPAA in 2022and has worked closely with faculty to roll out Graceland’s innovative Transformational Leadership major. Shrock brings nearly 30 years of higher education experience to the role, including posts at Anderson University, Ball State University, and Miami University (Ohio). He will begin working with President Draves on the transition immediately, and Draves will begin her new role at Monmouth in July.

“I am grateful for the faith of the board of trustees, and I look forward to continuing to make progress toward our Blue, Gold & Bold Strategic Framework,” said Shrock. “President Draves and I both share a strong commitment and belief that an innovative liberal arts education opens doors for students and changes communities. Graceland’s legacy of creating transformational leaders for the world will only grow as we continue to invest in our students’ experiences.”

Wiley shared the board’s enthusiasm to work with Dr. Shrock in his new capacity as Interim President. “Joel’s experience in higher education and his passion for academia gave our trustees a high level of confidence in naming him to lead Graceland,” Wiley said. “He has led the faculty for the past two years with a steadiness and sureness that we on the board know will translate to strong, steady leadership and a continued culture of innovation at the University during this important transition.”
