The Television Academy announced Saturday that Jordan Wayne Long, a 2008 Graceland University graduate, is among the winners of the 69thLos Angeles Area Emmy Awards.

Long, who graduated from Graceland with a degree in Communications: Speech, won in the category of Entertainment Programming for his role as producer for the documentary Fallujah: Art, Healing and PTSD.

Fallujah, with a score composed by Tobin Stokes and a libretto by Iraqi-American Heather Raffo, explores how the experience of war can be turned into a work of art. The documentary chronicles the process of the Long Beach Opera’s creation of the first opera about the Iraq war, inspired by U.S. Marine Sergeant Christian Ellis.

Ellis, a machine gunner in Iraq, was just one of only a few survivors when his platoon was ambushed, leaving him with a broken back and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He joined millions of American soldiers with the disorder upon his return home.
