The 2017 Top Graduate Schools represent colleges and programs all across the nation and are based completely on student feedback. Over 57,000 student reviews and ratings of over 1,600 colleges were compiled into rankings in order to highlight the best graduate schools according to students. It is due to extremely high student satisfaction ratings that Graceland University was selected as the number four spot in the Top Online Nursing Programs.
