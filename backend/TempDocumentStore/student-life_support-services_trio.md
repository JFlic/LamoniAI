Save Your Spot for Fall 2025 on the Lamoni Campus

Graceland University’s Student Support Services (SSS) is a TRIO grant program funded by the U.S. Department of Education. The program is designed to provide individualized assistance to eligible students encouraging their persistence and success in college.

Their goal is to increase the retention and graduation rates of those traditionally under-represented in post-secondary education. The program provides intentional interventions proven to boost academic, social and personal readiness for the attainment of a bachelor’s degree.

Nationally, students in the SSS TRIO program are more than twice as likely to remain in college as students from similar background who do not participate in the program.

To be eligible for assistance from Student Support Services, you must be a U.S. citizen and meet at least one of the following guidelines:
