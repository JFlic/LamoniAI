# About Graceland University: Mission, Vision, Values

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/about/?pg=144#top

We are a university grounded in the liberal arts and dedicated to providing the progressive academic needs of the 21st century student.

Since 1895, Graceland University has been developing students into people who will change the world by giving them the best experience and education possible. But we believe that providing a strong liberal arts learning environment — at our main residential campus in Lamoni, our Independence campus and through our online programs — is just one piece of the puzzle. Just as important are our amazing faculty, who care about their students’ success; our fun, on-campus activities that build forever friendships; and the powerful sense of place and belonging we cultivate every day.

About Graceland

Graceland University will become a recognized educational leader, inspiring and empowering persons for transformational service and leadership.

Graceland values learning, wholeness and community. Graceland encourages the development of these values for the enrichment of lives and the betterment of the world.

We believe in the lifelong process of the open and free pursuit of truth.

We believe that the development of the intellectual, physical, social and spiritual dimensions of all persons is necessary for healthy and fulfilling lives.

We appreciate and welcome diversity and, as an institution sponsored by Community of Christ, believe in the inherent worth of all persons expressed through relationships built on the foundation of unconditional love and acceptance.
