Skinner was named one of the ten most forward-thinking innovators in enrollment.

October 11, 2022

Graceland Vice President for Enrollment and Strategic GrowthDeb Skinner, MEd has been selected to represent Graceland on the Enrollment Advisory Board’s (EAB) Innovator Council.

Skinner, who graduated from Graceland in 1993, is one of a select few enrollment leaders across the country who will meet regularly to discuss and collaborate enrollment in higher education. The EAB Innovator Council will provide a forum for free and open discussion on the most significant issues facing graduate, adult, and online education leaders today and foster ideas around solutions.

Jennifer Winn, Senior Vice President and General Manager at EAB said, “We are thrilled that Deb is joining EAB’s Innovator’s Council, a group of ten of the nation’s most forward-thinking enrollment leaders in the graduate and adult degree completion space. Graceland’s long history of innovation along with Deb’s leadership and passion for developing next-generation enrollment solutions to attract mission-critical adult learners back to higher education has us all at EAB very excited Deb is joining this distinguished group of fellow leaders.”

Graceland’s history of innovation in enrollment reaches back to the inception of the University. Graceland’s launch as a non-sectarian institution was innovative at the time and the University has continued to push boundaries, from the development of its distance learning (now online)graduate nursingdegrees to its purchase ofSkillPath.

“Deb is a fantastic leader and has made incredible strides to improve Graceland’s enrollment and position the University for growth in the coming years,” said Graceland PresidentPatricia H. Draves, PhD. “EAB will benefit greatly from Deb’s contributions to the Innovator Council and Graceland is extremely proud of her acknowledgement.”
