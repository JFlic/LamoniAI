October 4, 2024 | jns

A very special homecoming is on display on the Lamoni campus,featuring the exhibitTranquilo & Tropicalby alumna Kari Cardiel ’17.

A native of Morelia, Mexico, Cardiel graduated from Graceland as an Honors student, with two bachelor’s degrees in Visual Communications and Social Media Marketing. Of her formative Graceland experience, she says:

“The programs shaped me into who I am today, and taught me to challenge myself. With my Visual Communications major, I had the freedom to be creative and explore. I still remember being introduced to Adobe Creative Suite and realizing all the possibilities I had with a computer. The Honors program was also formative—it taught me time management and gave me the confidence to tackle challenging tasks. My time on the tennis team helped me develop the strong teamwork skills that I still use today.”

She now works at Gurrimatute, an award-winning architecture firm, where she started as a Graphic Designer and is now the Technology Manager. In her free time, she is developing her expertise by delving deeper into UX/UI design.

Cardiel’s artwork brings theTranquilo & Tropicalsides of Miami and southern Florida to Lamoni. It is inspired by the energy and vibrance, shapes and colors of the city’s neighborhoods and the surrounding area. To Cardiel, Miami has a certain type of magic that she seeks to capture and translate into her print designs and digital displays—thatyou can discover now through November 22 at the Constance Art Gallery in Helene Center.
