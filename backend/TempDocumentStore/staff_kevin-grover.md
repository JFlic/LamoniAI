Kevin is a retired educator with 31 years of experience in the Blue Springs School District, a suburb of Kansas City, MO. Over the years, he served as a high school science teacher, assistant principal, associate principal, and lead principal at both middle and high school levels. Throughout his career, Kevin remained dedicated to interacting with students daily, always prioritizing their needs and focusing on how best to serve them. His passion for helping students navigate their paths, particularly in choosing higher education, aligns with his deep commitment to student success.

Kevin and his wife, Janné, reside in Lee’s Summit, MO, and are proud of their three children, all of whom attended Graceland University, where they participated in various activities. Inspired by his family’s positive experiences at Graceland, Kevin is eager to help other students discover a supportive environment where they can grow and thrive.

After 31 years in public education, with 24 of those in school administration, I wanted to stay engaged with something that positively impacts others. My three children each found their place at Graceland University, each pursuing their own unique path while being embraced by a community that elevates them. Graceland has provided them with opportunities to excel academically, socially, and personally. Now, as an admissions advisor, I want to help other students discover that same supportive environment, where they can grow and thrive. Graceland’s 'Carry it Forward' philosophy truly encapsulates the transformative experience it offers.
