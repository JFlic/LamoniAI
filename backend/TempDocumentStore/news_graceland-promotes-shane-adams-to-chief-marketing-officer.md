Graceland is excited to announce the promotion of Shane Adams to Chief Marketing Officer.

August 17, 2021

Graceland is excited to announce the promotion of Shane Adams to Chief Marketing Officer. A 1999 Graceland graduate, Adams has been serving as the director of marketing and communications since November of 2018.

“Over the past three years, Shane has worked to transform the marketing department to a more strategic and agile organization,” said Graceland President Patricia Draves. “As the University continues to transform to meet the needs of new students, it is critical for our marketing messaging to clearly state the value of the Graceland education and experience. Shane understands that value and I look forward to continuing to work with him to showcase the value of Graceland.”

Before Graceland, Adams worked in a variety of marketing roles for Fortune 500 companies like AMC Theatres, Chipotle and Cerner. He helped pioneer the brand social media voice at AMC Theatres and brought a new collaborative approach to marketing at Graceland with the support of a talented and experienced team of creative strategists.

“Graceland is a part of my DNA,” Adams said. “I can’t remember a time in my life where Graceland hasn’t influenced me or played a role in my success, and as Chief Marketing Officer, I intend to continue telling the Graceland story to anyone and everyone who will listen, because the world needs more Graceland students – thoughtful, community-oriented world-changers.”

Over the years, the marketing department has evolved to focus on more big picture projects for Graceland, including overseeing all internal and external strategic communications, producing and publishing theHorizonsalumni magazine, executing Graceland’s social media channels, and supporting enrollment at both of the University’s campuses.

Adams and the marketing department have two major projects that will launch very soon – a newly designed graceland.edu and a video viewbook – both designed to help support enrollment into the future and tell Graceland’s story with more clarity.

The marketing department will report to the recently-named Vice President for Institutional Advancement Kristi Hettrick. Hettrick said this about Adams: “The next version of Graceland University will challenge each of us to move forward with the ‘fierce urgency of now.’ Shane’s strong background in digital transformation and unique ability to help elevate our sightlines on what is possible for our students enables us to truly meet this moment in the Graceland story. We are grateful for his current leadership and excited for what he will help us create in the years ahead.”
