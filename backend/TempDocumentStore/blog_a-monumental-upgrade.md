Graceland’s Marketing team partnered with Kansas City-based Midtown Signs to repurpose the existing brick and stone framework and replace the outdated logo treatment on the aluminum faces, bringing the signage current with the new logo. The signs flank both sides of campus at key points of entry — one up the hill from Founders Lake along College Avenue and the other adjacent to The Helene Center for the Visual Arts at the corner of University Place.

One of the central efforts of Graceland’sBlue, Gold & BoldStrategic Framework is a focus on increasing the visibility and awareness of the University. Along with the national brand campaign, this also means addressing high impact areas like campus signage to effectively reinforce the Graceland identity and extend a sense of welcome and pride to anyone who steps foot on campus, or even just passersby.

Not only do the monuments now reflect the University’s current logo, but they provide a backdrop for recruits, students, and alumni to take meaningful snapshots, and in the age of social media, extend Graceland’s reach by sharing these images with their friends and followers. These unofficial “brand ambassadors” showing their connection to Graceland is a true marketing win.

LASTING IMPRESSIONSSignage is so foundational and important by creating a positive touch point for visitors to campus. The monuments coming into Lamoni along Highway 69 were also refreshed, and Graceland’s signage at the Independence campus and at the SkillPath building in Mission, Kan. were updated recently as well.

Next time you visit campus, we invite you to strike a pose and snap a photo of your own, then share on social media and make sure to tag us!
