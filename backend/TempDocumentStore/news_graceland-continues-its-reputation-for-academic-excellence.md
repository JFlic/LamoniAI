Graceland is very pleased to announce that the Online Graduate Education, Online Graduate Nursing, and Online Bachelor’s programs have received excellent rankings again this year by U.S. News and World Report for 2014.

*Best Online Graduate Education ProgramGraceland’s Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education ranked 11th (out of 166)

*Best Online Graduate Nursing ProgramGraceland’s School of Nursing ranked 10th (out of 95)

*Best Online Bachelor’s ProgramGraceland’s Online Bachelor’s Program ranked 65th (out of 205)

The 2014 rankings evaluate information and data from nearly 1,000 online degree programs, up from 860 programs the previous year. Only degree-granting programs offering classes entirely online were considered.President Sellars praised the nursing and education faculty and staff noting, “It is no easy task to be recognized in the top 20 of anything in higher education, given there are so many colleges and universities. They are to be commended for their effort and competence.”

“We’re excited that we’re meeting the standards again this year. We have an incredible faculty and staff who work really hard to earn such a high ranking in the country,” said Claudia Horton, Dean of the School of Nursing.

“The Gleazer School of Education provides uniquely specialized education programs that will continue to be competitive in national rankings. We are happy to see the report,” stated the Dean of the Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education, Tammy Everett.

On line education plays an increasingly important role in higher education. Graceland is meeting the challenge by consistently providing academic excellence.
