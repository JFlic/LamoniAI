Graceland University has partnered with Culver-Stockton College in Canton, Missouri, to offer a Master of Athletic Training with a concentration in Human and Sport Performance degree. Students in this 3+2 program will complete three years of coursework at Graceland, then enroll as a senior at Culver-Stockton to complete the remaining two years.

After the first year at Culver-Stockton, the student will return to Graceland to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Allied Health. Once the second year at Culver-Stockton is complete, the student will have concluded all necessary coursework to earn their master’s degree.

The 3+2 agreement allows students to gain the necessary education and skills to pass the licensure exam one year faster than other students competing for similar career positions. This agreement affords students the opportunity to receive hands-on preparation during their undergraduate experience.

“Students will have the opportunity to graduate with an undergraduate and graduate degree within five years instead of six,” says Andrew Miller, program director and instructor of athletic training at Graceland University. “Not only does this reduce the length of time they will be in school, but it reduces overall costs and allows students to start their careers a year earlier.”

Both Graceland and Culver-Stockton are small liberal arts institutions with similar values and mission, and Culver-Stockton’s small campus in a small town mirrors the environment of Graceland’s Lamoni campus in southern Iowa. The Graceland University Allied Health program and the Culver-Stockton College Master of Athletic Training program utilize a similar teaching model providing a smooth transition from undergraduate to graduate studies. Both programs educate students by working with future patients, clients or athletes and prepares the top future professionals within the field. Culver-Stockton has been successful in partnering with other institutions such as Illinois College and Missouri Valley College to offer similar programs.

“The 3+2 Masters of Athletic Training program allows students to reach their goal of becoming an athletic trainer in five years while still experiencing the full curriculum of the Allied Health – Human and Sport Performance concentration. The hands-on evidence approach afforded by this program is designed to prepare students for successful, fulfilling careers in athletic training.”

– Bryan Gatzke,Assistant Professor of Health and Movement Science
