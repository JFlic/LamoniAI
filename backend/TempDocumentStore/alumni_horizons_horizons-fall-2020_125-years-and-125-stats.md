A collection of 125 details from Graceland’s history for you to enjoy.

Our Graceland history is made of everything from impressive buildings to major decisions, but it is also intricately woven with bricks and paint, and with the interests of the people who determined it. The first 125 years of the Graceland experience includes vision, trials, love, undoubtedly some snorting laughter — and everything in between.

There was just one graduate in the first graduating class of Graceland College.

Frederick Madison Smithwas presented the first Graceland diploma June 15, 1898. The son of Joseph Smith III, Frederick’s Graceland legacy lives on today. He is the namesake for the library on the Lamoni campus, as well as the snack shop within it, playfully named Freddie’s Café.

Briggs Hall was the second building built on Graceland’s Lamoni campus.

Throughout its history, Briggs Hall has housed classrooms, a dormitory, the home economics department and a library. Today, Briggs Hall houses the C.H. Sandage School of Business, the humanities department faculty offices, the information technology services department and classrooms for general use. The three levels of Briggs stairs are notorious for causing students to lose their breath as they make their way to class.

The name of the Higdon Administration Building was chosen to honor the three members of the Higdon family who collectively served as the college’s president for nearly a quarter century.

Courses during Graceland’s initial years were divided into five programs:

collegiate (with classical or scientific emphases), preparatory (a two-year high school equivalency offering), commercial (business instruction), shorthand and typewriting, and music.

The class of 1945 had 75 students, but just six of them were male.

By 1944, during World War II, Graceland had begun to resemble an all-female school, as male enrollment became limited to those who were not yet 18 and those who could not pass the army physical exam.

There were seven lettermen during the first track and field season in 1909.

Bud O’Dell ’59 received $10 in the contest to name Big G Lake in 1959.

The actual big, yellow G was added in November 1960 and had yellow paint mixed into the concrete. Today, the space between the lake and road where the G is located has grills, benches and a dock, donated by the homecoming honor class of 2011, and is often used for student recreation.

Graceland’s computer science and information technology major was developed by Dennis Steele and introduced 46 years ago in 1974.

Upper division courses during the program’s early years were Switching Theory, Computer Design, Modeling and Simulation.

There were 66 contest entries to name the Swarm Inn in 1963.

The contest began Oct. 24 and was supposed to end Nov. 15 but was extended into December to allow for more name suggestions. In December, the contest’s prize was announced to be a newly designed Graceland blazer. Students submitted entries in the slot by the door to the MSC roller skating booth. Suggestions were judged by a committee, with the Council on Student Life selected the name “Swarm Inn” in January 1963 based on the suggestion “The Swarm Room” by Edwards House freshman Les Hall ’68. On Feb. 1, 1963The Towerreported that the name “typifies the purpose and activity of the snack shop. Since Yellowjackets do not hive, but instead gather in a swarm, an appropriate center for their gathering and activity is the ‘Swarm Inn’.” 21 of the 66 entries used the words “hive,” “nest” or “honeycomb.”

Over a weekend in February 1960, 67 women moved into the newly built first wing of Tess Morgan Hall.

80 blocks make up the wall sculpture in the Shaw Center lobby.

The clay wall mural, entitledThe Seed,ws commissioned in 1979 by Jay ’64 and Cherry ’65 Newcom in honor of Jay’s parents, Loyal and Arden Newcom. It was designed by Dan Keegan (Graceland art faculty member from 1974-76 and 1980-90) with assistance from Kauila “Mel” Clark ’67 (Graceland art faculty member from 1971-84), Ember Moonbourn ’75, Dewey Keaweehu ’84 and Patty Kochaver ’84.

The plaque for the mural reads, “Education nurtures the seed, or core of people, so they come into full bloom.” During the 2012 Shaw Center renovation, the entire mural was removed and replaced, which took a toll on the sculpture. It was repaired in 2014 in part by Kimberly Manuel ’01, who now works in the building as Assistant Professor of Theatre and Scene Design.

Commitment ’81 was a four-year fundraising campaign announced in January 1977 that began with a $5 million target.

Two of the campaign’s goals were to raise money to construct a campus chapel and a performing arts auditorium, however, the success of the campaign allowed for the construction of the entire performing arts center as well as a chapel.

Graceland’s mascot has been the Yellowjackets for 94 years.

Graceland went 31 years without a nickname for its athletic teams. Sports reports on games during those years simply referred to a Graceland squad as “the navy-gold team.” In the fall of 1926, students and faculty decided to nominate nicknames, which were put up to a campus wide vote. The mascot name was announced in November 1926, as the Yellow Jackets, which was eventually melded into a single word. There was not an official design for the Yellowjacket mascot until around 1950.

The suggestion of the mascot was inspired by the many yellow jackets that buzzed inside and around the administration building. Sports enthusiasts back in 1926 reported that they liked the speed, the surety of aim and the fiery zip suggested this small fighter.

Graceland Foreverwas written 95 years ago in 1925 by student Warren McElwain ’25.

McElwain was inspired to write a Graceland song after an enthusiastic chapel convocation, during which Roy Cheville ’21 expressed the hope that Graceland would someday have its own songs and suggested that Gracelanders should be the ones to write them.

McElwain went back to his room at Herald hall and prayed for guidance about Cheville’s words. One night, he dreamed he was at a college prep meeting and that there was a college band dressed in uniforms and leading a parade, playing a march he had never heard. McElwain awoke with the melody still in his mind. He hummed it over a few times and decided to write it down in the morning, but when he awoke, his mind was blank.

Later in the day, he began to recall parts of the melody until had it all in his mind and wrote down the tune. A few days later, he wrote the words while sitting in the library in the administration building.Graceland Foreverwas the only song McElwain ever wrote and published.

Africa was first represented at Graceland 96 years ago when Michael Johannedes ’26 came from Cairo, Egypt, in 1924.

During the fall of 1987, the station was relocated from the Chief Lamoni Motel to a room on the MSC mezzanine. A student staff began regular broadcasts from 6-11 p.m. in October that year, but equipment failures ended the effort in 1988. Today, you can listen to Kbuz, Graceland’s student-run radio station, at radio.graceland.edu.

Crescents were first introduced at Graceland 98 years ago in 1922.

“We want 99!”That was the chant from the crowd at the 1961 homecoming game when Clara Morrell, who served as administrative assistant to seven Graceland College presidents, became the only woman to ever play in a football game for the Graceland Yellowjackets.

She had been asked to suit up as #99 at the Friday night pep rally, and coach Harry Larche asked her to sit on the team bench for the next day’s game. After chants from the crowd — and with a safe Graceland lead over Tarkio in the fourth quarter — Larche sent Morrell into the game with specific instructions to run just 15 yards. In 1995, at the age of 79, Morrell donned her uniform again for that year’s homecoming pep rally.

The college yearbook was first published in 1912 as a project of the Athenian Literary Society. The name is a reference to the acacia plant and was suggested by preparatory student Peter T. Chosokabe of Japan in a contest that drew more than 50 submissions. Chosokabe explained the significance of theAcacianame in a piece he wrote for the first yearbook. “The word shall be well compared to the distinctions of our college annual; the virtue of acacia to the virtue of Graceland College; the perfume of acacia to the sweet memories of old students; its euphonious sound to the peaceful atmosphere of the college location.”
