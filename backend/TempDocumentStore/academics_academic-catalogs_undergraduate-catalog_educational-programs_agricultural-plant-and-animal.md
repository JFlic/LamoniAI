# Agricultural Plant and Animal Science

Minor

A minor in Agricultural Plant and Animal Sciences requires 19 semester hours to include:

An analytical course in agronomy applying multiple perspectives in studying crops, soils, and environmental sciences to understand the interconnectedness of agricultural systems in global communities. Includes questioning the sources of assumptions about and the strengths/weaknesses of past innovations of production and management. Recognizes the soil and crops as the sources of food, fiber, and fuel and emphasizes the need for diverse innovation in varied ecosystems to improve global conditions. ELO4 Global Learning - Innovation

+This course is only offered every other year.

A study of the diversity of life (prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants, and animals), focusing on the key characteristics of life, the evolutionary processes that shape life, and the ecological interactions among organisms and their physical environments.  Includes a lab.  Additional fee required.

A comparative study of form and function across organisms, focusing on the various structures and strategies used by plants and animals to fulfill basic life needs, levels of organization (cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems), and the chemical reactions of metabolism.  Includes a lab. Additional fee required.

A survey of the major groups in the animal kingdom, including sponges, cnidarians, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, vertebrates, etc. Within each group, taxonomy, internal and external form, reproduction, nutrition, and habitat will be considered. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: BIOL1500, BIOL1520 or instructor's consent.

+This course is only offered every other year.

A survey of the major groups in the plant kingdom, including nonvascular plants, ferns and fern allies, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. Within each group, taxonomy, internal and external form, and reproductive life cycles will be considered. In addition, plant growth and metabolism, algae, and fungi will be covered. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: BIOL1500, BIOL1520 or instructor's consent.

+This course is only offered every other year.

An exploration of the biotic and abiotic components of the environment, including the biological, physical, and chemical processes that shape natural ecosystems (e.g., biogeochemical cycles). The course will also examine the impact of human population growth, resource use, emissions production, and technological innovations on the environment. Current environmental issues, such as loss of biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, air and water pollution, and climate change, will be considered.  Additional fee required. ELO6 Science -  Innovation, GE3D Liberal Learning-Natural Sciences.
