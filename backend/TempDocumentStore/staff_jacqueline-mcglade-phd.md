With decades of international experience in providing academic affairs leadership and accreditation process consultation, Jacqueline McGlade supports the faculty as Interim Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty.

Among others, McGlade served as Interim Associate Dean for the Monmouth University School of Science, Technology and Engineering, as Associate Dean for the University of Northern Iowa Division of Graduate Programs, and as Chief Academic Officer at Penn State Shenango.

She comes to Graceland having most recently served as Interim Vice President for Academic Affairs at Wheeling University in West Virginia, where she led academic operations, oversaw curriculum development and programs accreditation, and provided oversight of the university’s re-accreditation efforts with the Higher Learning Commission (HLC).

Under McGlade’s guidance, preparations for Graceland’s upcoming HLC re-affirmation set for 2026/27 are well underway.

As an Iowa transplant to Nebraska, she feels very much at home in this interim role, traveling between the Graceland University sites in Lamoni/IA, Independence/MO, and Mission/KS.

Dr. Shrock has set a great table for progress and innovation with the faculty, and I am excited to carry this mission forward with the professors and staff at Graceland.
