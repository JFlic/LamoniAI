Vice President for Institutional Advancement Kristi Hettrick ’96 promoted Angela Slosarski and Georgia Seagraves ’21 to new roles on the Development team. Slosarski formerly served as an executive assistant to the vice president for institutional advancement and recently moved into her new role as associate director of annual giving and campaign relations. She will design, direct, and champion a best-practices, metrics-driven annual giving program (“The Graceland Fund”) that consistently engages and maximizes annual gift income from trustees, alumni, parents, friends, corporations, and all supporters of Graceland University.

Slosarski graduated from Clarkson College in Omaha, Nebraska, with a degree in healthcare administration and worked in administrative roles in long-term care facilities until she came to Graceland in 2021 as the administrative assistant for visual and performing arts. After assisting Hettrick with the vice president of academic affairs search committee, she was promoted to executive assistant for advancement. Just shy of one year later, her talents, work ethic, and dedication earned her another promotion into her new annual giving role.

“I’m thrilled to take on this new role, but I’m even more thankful to be a part of this exceptional community. I’m excited to do my part in driving the mission forward as we honor the Graceland of yesterday, support the Graceland of today, and build the Graceland of the future,” said Slosarski.

At Graceland, Seagraves served on Graceland Student Government as the council of house chaplains president and was an active member of the theatre department and Enactus. After graduation, she worked as the marketing and communications specialist for Graceland University. She has since been promoted to associate director of advocacy and alumni engagement, where she will collaborate with alumni to create opportunities for networking and connecting. She will also design and lead a comprehensive, multi-channel fundraising and advocacy program. This month, Seagraves will graduate with her master’s in political management from George Washington University and is excited to apply her knowledge to her new role. Seagraves’s pursuit of a master’s degree in political management will be a tremendous asset for her advocacy, grant writing, and community-building work for the University.

“I have always seen and felt the value of a Graceland education,” said Seagraves. “I cannot tell you how special it is to be a part of the amazing group of people that helps to share that experience with others,” she continued.

When asked about the recently promoted duo, Hettrick said, “I am grateful that Georgia and Angela have agreed to these exciting new roles and continue to serve Graceland. Both are thoughtful and creative leaders who strive to put students at the center of their work, and we are extremely fortunate to have their talents and expertise in these mission-critical roles for the success of the university.”
