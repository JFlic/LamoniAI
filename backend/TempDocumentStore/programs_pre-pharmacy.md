# Pre-Pharmacy

Special Program

Students interested in pursuing a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree should major inBiologyorChemistry(with a Biology minor). For the best preparation, we recommend a double major in both Biology and Chemistry. Students should review the admissions requirements for the pharmacy schools of their choice. We recommend that students complete the following courses (along with the requirements for a major in Biology, Chemistry, or both) for preparation for admission and success in pharmacy school:

During summers, students should consider internships or volunteer experiences at local hospitals or pharmacies to gain practical experience. Most students take the PCAT exam in June of their junior year and begin to apply to pharmacy schools during the summer following their junior year. Early application using the PharmCAS application service is strongly recommended.

Developed in conjunction with and approved by an appropriate faculty member in the Biological Sciences. This internship will be with professionals who are in career areas relating to majors in the department and may be pursued abroad. The student is responsible for arranging their internship. May be repeated for a maximum of 9 semester hours. (Graded on a Pass/Fail basis.) Prerequisite: Instructor’s consent.

A study of cellular processes involved in the Central Dogma: DNA replication, transcription and translation. The study will include how gene expression is regulated at various levels, such as at the transcription level and post-translational level. Lastly students will study and perform different molecular genetic techniques used in laboratories today: pipetting, DNA gel electrophoresis, PCR and DNA cloning. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: BIOL2100 (C or better strongly recommended). +This course is only offered every other year.

A study of gross human anatomy utilizing charts, three dimensional models, computer simulations, and dissection of mammalian animals. The course will discuss regional and surface anatomy to establish the relationships of the various organ systems of the body. Additional fee required. Prerequisites: BIOL2100 or PHED1500.

A systems oriented study of the function of the human body on the cellular, tissue, organ, and organ-system levels with an emphasis on medical physiology. Laboratory includes computer simulations and use of Biopac equipment. Additional fee required. Prerequisites: BIOL3420 (grade of C or better strongly recommended) and one semester of chemistry or BIOL2100.

An introduction to biologically important molecules and metabolic pathways and the laboratory techniques used to study and characterize them. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: CHEM3420/3421 and BIOL2100. +This course is only offered every other year.

Investigation of the innate and adaptive immune system, including inflammation, B and T cell development and function, immunization and its role in human health. Prerequisites: BIOL2100 and BIOL2360 (grade of C or better strongly recommended). +This course is only offered every other year.

Students will investigate the cellular mechanisms of cancer and then will learn about a few specific cancers. Includes an in-depth study of the multistage model of carcinogenesis, genes involved in cancer, activation of cancer genes, signal transduction pathways that promote carcinogenesis, the mechanism of metastasis, apoptosis, how cancer treatments work, and the new potential cancer treatments. Prerequisite: BIOL2100 (grade of C or better strongly recommended). 

+This course is only offered every other year.

Study of theory and practice of modern separation and analytical techniques. Includes use of electrochemical, spectrometric and chromatographic instruments. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: CHEM1420. Offered odd years Spring.

Data analysis and measures of central tendency, dispersion, and correlation. Introduction to probability. Estimation and hypothesis testing. Bivariate regression. ANOVA. Introduction to nonparametric techniques. ELO6 Math, GE2B Foundational Skills-Mathematics/Quantitative.

Limits, continuity, differentiation, and applications including exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse functions. Mean value theorem, curve sketching, Riemann sums, and the fundamental theorem of calculus. Prerequisite: 2 years high school algebra. ELO6 Math, GE2B Foundational Skills-Mathematics/Quantitative.
