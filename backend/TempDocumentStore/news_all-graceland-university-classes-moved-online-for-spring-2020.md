# All Graceland University Classes Moved Online for Spring 2020 | Graceland

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/news/all-graceland-university-classes-moved-online-for-spring-2020/#top

March 17, 2020

In light of the recommendations made by the U.S. Government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and with the health and well-being of Graceland students, employees and our local communities in mind, Graceland University has made the difficult decision to move all Spring 2020 classes to an online format for the remainder of the semester.

Lamoni-campus students are strongly encouraged to continue to stay at home or in their permanent residence rather than return to campus. Students will be required to notify Residence Life by 5 p.m. Friday, March 20, if they plan to return, or if they are already on campus and plan to stay. Limited dining options will be available pending state and federal guidelines for those who stay on campus. Graceland will also ask that students follow previous guidance and, if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to the virus, that they please follow CDC guidelines and seek medical advice before returning to Lamoni.

Spring sports have already been canceled by the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and student-athletes participating in spring sports will not lose a year of competitive eligibility.

Additionally, in adherence to the CDC’s guidelines, Graceland’s Spring 2020 Commencement Ceremony has been canceled. Conversations are already taking place to develop an alternative plan, and more information will be announced related to that at a later time, however it is important to note that current seniors will be able to graduate on time.

Graceland recognizes there remain many unanswered questions, especially for our students, and the university will continue to work to answer all questions related to the impact of this decision. Please continue to check the university’sCOVID-19 webpagefor the most up-to-date details.
