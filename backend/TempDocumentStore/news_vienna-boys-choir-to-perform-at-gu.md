LAMONI, IOWA (November 5, 2012)—The famed Vienna Boys’ Choir will perform for one night only on Monday, November 12, at Graceland University.

The internationally-renowned Vienna Boys’ Choir performs around the world at some of the most prestigious arts venues. On Monday, November 12, at 7:30 p.m. they will appear in the Shaw Family Auditorium in the recently expanded Shaw Center, now one of the most beautiful performing arts venues in the Midwest.

Tickets to see the Vienna Boys’ Choir typically cost more than $100 but for this special concert, patrons of the arts at Graceland can obtain general admission tickets for just $10. There is no reserved seating. It is expected that this concert will sell out quickly. To order tickets today, call the Shaw Center Box Office at 641-784-5270.

Graceland’s expanded Shaw Center was dedicated with gala concerts and events Homecoming Weekend October 19-21. The tremendous Shaw Family Auditorium will be a perfect match for the powerful sounds of perhaps the greatest boys’ choir in the world.

Choir Master Kerem Sezen was born into a family of opera singers in Istanbul in 1978. Sezen has conducted choirs in Vienna and been active as a singer and soloist for many years. Over the last decade, he has conducted the Vienna Boys’ Choir in nearly 700 concerts in Vienna and on tours through Europe, the USA, China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Dubai, Australia, and New Zealand, appearing in venues such as New York’s Carnegie Hall, Orchestra Hall in Chicago, Suntory Hall and Opera City in Tokyo, The Esplanade, Singapore and the Oriental Art Centre in Shanghai.

Historians have settled on 1498 as the foundation date of the Vienna Hofmusikkapelle which became the Vienna Boys’ Choir. Until 1918, the choir sang exclusively for the imperial court, at mass, at private concerts and functions, and on state occasions.

Today there are approximately 100 choristers between the ages of 10 and 14, divided into four touring choirs. The four choirs give about 300 concerts and performances each year in front of almost half a million people. Each group spends nine to 11 weeks of the school year on tour. They visit virtually all European countries, and they are frequent guests in Asia, Australia and the Americas.

Don’t miss your chance to see one of the most celebrated boys choirs in the world at Graceland University at a remarkably low price. Call the Shaw Center Box Office today at 641-784-5270 or stop by the Box Office, located in the Atrium of the Shaw Center on Graceland’s Lamoni campus.
