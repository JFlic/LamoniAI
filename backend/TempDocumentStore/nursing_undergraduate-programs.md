We are a caring community dedicated to the physical, intellectual and spiritual well-being of each individual. Gracelanders join together to create an atmosphere of openness, mutual respect and diversity.

Graceland University is a nonsectarian institution of higher education open to students of all faiths that was founded in Lamoni, Iowa, in 1895 by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now Community of Christ. Graceland University continues its commitment to helping all students find their own path to success by providing a holistic liberal arts education that prepares students for contemporary careers and lifelong learning.

More than a century later, Graceland continues its commitment to providing a solid liberal arts education along with professional preparation to a diverse student population. Today, Graceland students represent more than 40 states and 35 countries and can choose from a variety of academic programs, and over 20 varsity sports.

Graceland began as a high school academy and a two-year college. In 1917 it became Iowa’s first accredited junior college. Graceland conferred its first bachelor’s degree in 1958 and became a four-year college in 1960.

Graceland College became Graceland University in 2000 and began offering a variety of master-level degrees. It now offers multiple master’s degrees, a doctor of nursing practice, and will begin offering a doctor of physical therapy in January of 2024.

Graceland granted its first bachelor’s degree in nursing in 1969. Graceland’s School of Nursing (SON) is located on the Independence, Missouri campus (founded in 1969) where students can earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in nursing and education, including a Doctor of Nursing Practice. The Graceland SON was among the first in the nation, in 1987, to offer accredited distance education programs.

Today, the Edmund J. Gleazer School of Education provides innovative undergraduate degrees, on-site from both the Lamoni and Independence campuses, which lead to nationally accredited teacher licensure in the state where the student plans to teach.

Graceland’s C.H. Sandage School of Business is home to the Sandage Center for the Study of Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship and Graceland’s championship Enactus team, and offers undergraduate degrees in Accounting, Agricultural Business, Business Management, Finance, Marketing, Organizational Leadership, and Sport Management.

The Community of Christ Seminary at Graceland University was founded in 2002 and is based in Independence, MO, though all classes are administered online, with in-person focus sessions. Seminary students can receive a Master of Arts in Religion or a Master of Arts in Peace and Social Transformation.

In the fall of 2022, Graceland began offering a unique second major for all undergraduate students called Transformational Leadership. This unique approach to the liberal arts incorporates general education courses with annual life and leadership courses and strategic skills to prepare Graceland graduates with the skills that employers are seeking. Transformational Leadership is a first-of-its-kind program and gives all students a second major that quantifies marketable skills like communication, teamwork, and leadership.

Vision

Graceland University will become a recognized educational leader, inspiring and empowering persons for transformational service and leadership.

Mission

Graceland creates learning communities where students develop their potential for meaningful and productive lives.

Values

Graceland values learning, wholeness, and community. Graceland encourages the development of these values for the enrichment of lives and the betterment of the world.

Learning

We believe in the life long process of the open and free pursuit of truth.

Wholeness

We believe that the development of the intellectual, physical, social, and spiritual dimensions of all persons is necessary for healthy and fulfilling lives.

Community

We appreciate and welcome diversity and, as an institution sponsored by the Community of Christ, believe in the inherent worth of all persons expressed through relationships built on the foundation of unconditional love and acceptance.

Graceland University educates students for advanced study, for productive careers and for rich lives. Its student body is a targeted, yet diverse group that includes persons of different ages, backgrounds and national origins who share a commitment to learning. Its curriculum, firmly rooted in the liberal arts tradition and enhanced by career-oriented practical experiences, affirms different styles of learning and prepares students to become competent professionals. Its highly qualified faculty excel in teaching and engage in scholarly, creative and professional activities. Together with the administration and staff, they care deeply about students.

Graceland offers a learning environment for the residential as well as the non-residential student that nurtures personal growth. Its challenging academic program stresses the joy of lifelong learning, the rigor of intellectual discipline and the relationship of both to a satisfying professional and personal life. Its size fosters genuine concern for the individual while providing fellowship and a sense of belonging. For the residential student, its rich co-curricular program of interest groups, athletics, student government, residential life and leisure activities provides opportunity to develop interpersonal skills, relationships, creativity and leadership.

Based on the Christian values of human dignity, mutual respect and social responsibility, Graceland University welcomes persons of all faiths. It actively supports the counsel of its sponsoring denomination, the Community of Christ, to “learn by study and by faith” and indeed offers tangible expression of the church’s commitment to the open and free pursuit of knowledge through higher education.

Graceland promotes opportunity, justice and world peace through practical and visionary action.

Graceland’s educational model is designed to lead to five learning outcomes which are critical for students to have the necessary skills and competencies to lead productive lives and be competitively employable in today’s work force.
