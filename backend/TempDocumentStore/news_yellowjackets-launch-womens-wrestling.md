University excited to launch new program in the fall of 2025.

January 7, 2025

Graceland University is excited to announce the addition of women’s wrestling to its athletic programs, starting in the fall of 2025. This new initiative underscores the university’s commitment to expanding athletic opportunities and supporting the growing interest in women’s wrestling across the nation.

Over the past decade, women’s wrestling has experienced explosive growth. According to the National Federation of State High School Associations, the number of young women wrestling in high school has quintupled, illustrating the rising demand and popularity of the sport.

“Bringing women’s wrestling to Graceland is a milestone moment for our athletic department,” said Athletic Director Brady McKillip. “We are proud to embrace this momentum and offer opportunities for female athletes to excel on and off the mat. Our goal is to build a program rooted in excellence and inclusivity.”

To prepare for the program’s launch, Graceland University has already begun the search for a head coach to lead the new team. This recruitment effort reflects the university’s dedication to building a strong foundation for the program and ensuring its success from day one.

Graceland’s women’s wrestling team will compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), which officially recognized women’s wrestling as a championship sport in 2022. The new program will create opportunities for student-athletes to compete at a high level and continue their educational and athletic journeys.

Women’s wrestling is one of the fastest-growing sports in the country. By introducing this program, Graceland is excited to play a role in supporting the sport’s growth and providing female athletes with new paths to success.
