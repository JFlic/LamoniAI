# Campus Safety | Graceland University

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/student-life/campus-safety/#top

Graceland prides itself on offering a safe and nurturing academic and social environment for its students, staff and guests.

The safety of our students is a top priority for our university, but campus crime is, unfortunately, inevitable. This page includes Graceland’s reports provided to the federal government in accordance with the Clery Act, as well as some helpful information for students seeking other information on campus safety and security.

Personal Safety Recommendations:Do not walk alone during the hours of darkness.

Annual Safety and Security ReportsLamoni Campus (LC)

##### Independence Campus (LC)

In operation on both our Lamoni, IA and Independence, MO campuses, GU Alert is an emergency notification system that will send a text message and/or an email when there is an emergency that needs to be quickly announced to a campus.  Messages are sent only in the event of a crisis. Graceland encourages all employees, students and faculty to enter their mobile number or email address to receive these notices.

A Per Mar security officer patrols the Lamoni campus seven nights per week, including all weekend long, ensuring that the campus is adequately monitored by trained security professionals. Should students or staff need to contact the Campus Safety office,they can be reached at641.784.5199or from any Graceland room or office by dialing 5199.

SafeRide and SafeWalk are student operated programs sponsored by Campus Ministries during the academic semester.

SafeRideoffers students a safe ride to their home or place of safety, operating Friday and Saturday nights, 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.

SafeWalkoffers a student companion to walk across campus, operating Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday each week, 8 p.m. to midnight.

To request either service, please call 641.784.5438 (LIFT).
