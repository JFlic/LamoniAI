# The Yellow Jackets | Graceland

From Marietta Walker’s foundational gift of land to establish the university, to Betty Welch’s efforts in pioneering women’s varsity athletics, and Margaret McKevit’s leadership in creating the nation’s first accredited distance-learning RN to BSN program, Graceland women have shaped a legacy of progress and purpose.

During Homecoming 2023, eight remarkable women gathered in the Higdon Administration Building to embark on a new journey of empowerment. With hearts united by a shared mission to uplift and inspire, they laid the foundation for a movement that would amplify the voices of women across Graceland’s campuses:The Yellow Jackets Women’s Philanthropy Circle.

This newly established, vibrant, women-led initiative is dedicated to supporting female students, faculty, and programs. More than a philanthropy circle, it is a community of graduates and friends who are committed to building opportunities for connection, collaboration, and meaningful change. Through their efforts, these women aim to make a lasting impact, not only at Graceland but beyond.

On behalf of the Yellow Jackets, members Ginelle Sakima Roberts ’01, Deb Knotts ’85 Skinner, and Kelly Shrock presented a check to the dance team in early December.

In the fall of 2024, The Yellow Jackets received their first four funding requests, each a testament to the power of community and shared purpose. The House President Supplies initiative helped house leaders foster meaningful connections and support women’s mental health through encouraging messages and creative expression. Dance Team Program Support addressed financial challenges, empowering the team to continue their nationally celebrated performances. A one-time guest speaker event featured alumna Kara Vojcsik ’04, whose workshops inspired confidence and empowerment among attendees. Finally, the Women’s Empowerment Monthly Speaker Series established a consistent space for critical conversations on equity, inclusion, and self-discovery, building a stronger sense of community. Together, these projects advanced mental health, representation, and achievement.

When the Yellow Jackets convened again at Homecoming 2024, nearly 20 women came together, donning their yellow jackets and carrying with them the same passion and determination that ignited this initiative a year earlier. With hearts full of hope and purpose, they voted to approve all four funding requests, signaling their belief in the transformative power of collective giving.

The Yellow Jackets Women’s Philanthropy Leadership Circle continues to grow, seeking individuals who are ready to join in this mission of change. Together, the circle aims to provide at least $15,000 annually for female-centered initiatives.

“We’re so excited to connect with alumni through this initiative — it’s a new way to give back, but it also honors the traditions of the incredible women who have always supported Graceland. From groups like the Crescents to individual donors, these women have shown up at just the right times to make a difference. Our hope is that alumni who feel the same passion will join us in lifting up today’s women, just as they were once supported during their time at Graceland.”

GINELLE SAKIMA ROBERTS ’01Senior Director of Major Gifts

Through The Yellow Jackets, Graceland’s alumnae and friends are crafting a legacy of empowerment, bonded by the belief that the world needs more Graceland graduates.

Together, we are changing lives and building a brighter future.

Membership requires a gift of $1,000 annually,* enabling the circle to review and vote on funding proposals for programs that recruit, retain, and support female students. *Alumnae aged 35 and under can spread their contribution over three years (or a monthly contribution of approximately $27), making meaningful participation accessible to younger members.
