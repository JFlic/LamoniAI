Your  friend t a k e s   you  th rough Ills valuable house. You  examine  the arches,  the  frescoes, the  grass plots, th e   fish  ponds,  th e   conservatories,  the parks  of deer, and  you  say within >ourself  or  you  say   aloud,  "W hat  d.d all  th is  cost?' You  see  a  costly  dia­ mond  flashing  iu  an  earring,  or  veil hear  a  costly  d ress  rustling  across  tho drawing  room,  or  you  see  a  high  m et­ tled  span  of  h o rses  harnessed  w ith  sil­ ver  and  gold,  and  you  begin  to  make an  estim ate  of  th e  value.

The  man who  owns  a  large estate cannot  instantly  tell you  all it Is worth. He  says. "1  will  estim ate so much  for  the  house so  much  for  the furniture,  so  m uch  for  laying  out the grounds,  so  mucli  for the  stock, so much  for  the  barn,  so  much  fjr the equipage,  adding  up  in  all  m aking  this aggregate.

Well,  my friends,  I  hear  so much about  our  m ansion  in  heaven, abcut its  fu rn itu re  and  th e  grand  surround­ ings,  that  I  w ant  to  know  how  much it  is  all  w orth  an d   w hat  has  actual y been  paid  for  it.  I  cannot  complete  in a month  nor  a  year  the  magnificent calculation but  before  1  get  through today  I  hope to  g.ve  you  the  figures. Ye  are  bought  w'.th  a  price"

The  second  installm ent  paid  Tor  our souls' clearance was the scene iu Quarantanla,  a mountainous region, full  of  caverns,  w here  are  today  pan­ t h e r s and  wild  beasts  of  all  sorts,  so t h a t you  m ust  now  go  there  armed with  knife  or  gun  or  pistol.

The rose in  the  cheek  of C hrist-that .Publius  L entullus,  in  his  letter  to  the Homan  senate,  ascribed  to  Jesus-that rose  had scattered its  petals. Absti­ nence  from  food  had  throw a  him  into emaciation. A  long  abstinence from food  recorded in  profane  history  is t h a t   of  th e  crew   o f  th e  ship  Juno.  F o r lw enty-three  days  they  had  nothing  to cat. But this  sufferer had  fasted  a month  and  ten  days  before  he  broke fast. Hunger must  have agonized every  fibre  of  th e   body  and  gnawed  on th e   stom ach  w ith   teeth  of  death.  The thought  of  a  m orsel  of  bread  or  m eat must have  thrilled the body  with something  like  ferocity. Turn  cut  a pack  of  men hungry  as  Christ was a-hungered,  and  if  they  had  strength with  one  yell  th ey   would  devour you as  a  kid. It  w as  in  th a t  pang  of  hun­ ger  th a t  Jesus  w as  accosted,  and  satan said,  'Now,  change  these stones, which look  like  bread,  into  an  actual  supply of  bread.' Had  tlie  temptation  come 10 you  and me  under  those  circum;  ta n ces  we  w ould  have  cried,  'Bread  it shall  be!'  and  been  almost  impatient .  t   th e  tim e  ta k e n   fo r  m astication,  but Christ  with  one  hand  beat  back  the hunger  and  w ith  the  other  hand  beat back  the  m onarch  of  darkness. 0  ye tempted  ones! Christ  was tempted. We  are  told  th a t  -Napoleon  ordered  a coat  of  mail  m ade, but  he  was not quite  certain  th a t  it  was  Impenetrable, so  he  said  to  th e   m anufacturer  of  the < o a t  of  m ail,  ' F u t  It  on  now  yourseir and  let us  try It.' And  with  shot after  shot  from   his  own  pistol the emperor  found out  that  it  was just -what  it  pretended  to  be,  a  good  coat of  mail. Then  the  man  received  a large  reward.

I  bless  God  th a t  the  same  coat  of mail  th a t  stru c k   back  the  weapons  or tem ptation  from   th e  head  of  C hrist  we may  now all  ·wear,  for  Jesus comes and  says: 'I  h a v e   been  tem pted,  and I  know   w hat  it  is  to  be  tem pted. Take t h i s   ro b e  t h a t   d e fe n d ed   me  and  w ear  it for  yourselves.  I  shall  see  you  through a l l   tr ia ls ,  a n d   I  s h a ll  see  you through a l l   tem ptation.*'

The  third  installm ent  paid  for  our redemption  was  the  agonizing  prayer in  Gethsemane As  I  sa t  in  th a t  gar­ den  at  the  foot  of  an  old  gnarled  and  i tw isted  olive  tree  the  historic  scene  I came  upon  me  overwhelmingly.  These  ' |  old  olive  trees  are  the  lineal  descend-< a n t s   o f  th o se  under  w hich  C h rist  stoo I I  a n d wept  and  knelt. Have  the  leaves j  o f whole  botanical  generations  told the  story  of  our  Lord's  agony  to  their successors? Next  to  Calvary  tne  solemnest  place  in  Palestine  is  Gethse­ mane. While  sitting  there  it  seemed as  if  I  could  hear  our  Lord's  prayer, laden  with  sobs  and  groans.  Can  this be  the  Jesus  who  gathered  fragrance from  the  frankincense  brought  to  his cradle  and  from  the  lilies  th a t  flung th e ir  sw eetness  into  his  serm ons  and from  the  box  of  alabaster  th a t  broke a t   h is  feet? Is  this  Jesus  the  com fort­ er  of  Bethany,  the  resurrector  a t  Nain, the  oculist  at  Bethsaida? Is  this  the Christ  whose frown  is  the storm , whose smile  is  the  sunlight,  the  spring  m orn­ ing  his  breath,  the  thunder  his  voice, tho  ocean  a  drop  on  the  tip  of  his finger,  heaven  a  sparkle  on  th e  bosom of  his  love,  the  universe  the  dust  of his  chariot  wheel? Is  th is  th e   C hrist who  is  able  to  heal  a  heartbreak  or hush  a  tempest  or  drown  a  world  of flood  immensity  w ith  his  glory? Be­ hold  him  In  prayer,  the  globules  of blood  by  sorrow  pressed  through  the skin  of  his  forehead-! What  an  in­ stallm ent  in  part  paym ent of  the  great­ est  price  that  was  ever  paid!

The  fourth  Installm ent  paid  for  odi* redemption  was  the  Saviour's  sham tria l. I  call  it  a  sham   tria l-th ere  has never  been  anything  so  indecent  or unfair  in  any  crim inal  court  as  was .witnessed  at the  trial  of  C hrist. Why, they  hustled  him  into  the  court  room at  2  o 'clock in the m orning. They gave him  no  time  for  counsel. They  gave him  no  opportunity for  subpoenaing witnesses.  Tho ruffians who were wan­ dering  around  through  the  midnight, of  course  they saw  the  arrest  and  went into  the court room. But Jesus'  friends were  sober  men,  were  respectable  men, and  a t  th a t  hour, 2  o'clock  In th e   m orn­ ing,  of course they were at home asleep. Consequently  Christ  entered  the  court room  with  the  ruffians.

Oh,  look  at  him! No  one  to  speak a  word  for  him. I lift the  lantern until  I  can  look  into  his  face,  and  as my  heart  beats  in  sym pathy  for  this, the  best  friend  the  world  ever  had, himself  now  utterly  friendless,  an  offi­ cer  of  the  court  room  comes  up  and smites  him  in  the  m outh,  and  I  see  the blood  stealing  from  gum  and  lip. Oh, it  was  a  farce  of  a  trial,  lastin g   only perhaps  an  hour,  and  then  the  judge rises  for sentence! Stop! I t   is  a g a in st the  law   to  give  sentence  unless  there has  been  an  adjournm ent  of  the  court between  condemnation  and  sentence, but  w h at  cares  the  judge  for  the  law? 'The  man  has  no  friends. Let  him die,'  says  (.he  judge. And  the  ruf­ fians  outside-  the  rail  c r y 'Aha,  aha, th a t's what  we  w ant! Pass  him   out here  to  us! Away  with  him! Away with  h im '''

Oh,  I  bless  God  th a t  am id  all  the injustice  that  may  have  been  inflicted upon  us  in  this  world  we  have  a  di­ vine  sympathizer. The  world  cannot lie  about  you  nor  abuse  you  as  much as  they  did  Christ,  and  Jesus  stands to-day  in  every  court  room,  in  every house,  in  every store,  and  says:  ''Cour­ age' By  all  ray  hours  ot  m altreat­ ment and abuse I will protect those who are  tram pled  upon.' And when  Christ forgets  th at  2  o'clock  m orning  scene and  the  stroke  of  the  ruffian  on  the mouth and the howling of  the  unwash­ ed  crowd,  then  he  will  forget  you  and me in  the  injustices  of life  th a t  may  be inflictcd  upon  us.

Further,  I  remarkThe  last  great installm ent  paid  for  our  redemption was  the  demise  of  Christ. The  world has  seen  many  dark  days. Many sum­ mers  ago  there  was  a  very  dark  day when  the  sun  was  eclipsed. The  fowl a t   n o o n d ay   w ent  to   th e ir  perch,  and we  felt  a  gloom  as  we  looked  a t  tho astronom ical  wonder. I t was  a  dark

day  in  London  when  the  plague  was at  its  height,  and  the  dead  w ith  uncov­ ered  faces  were  taken  in  open  cart3 and  dumped  In  the  trenches. It  wa3 a  dark  day  when  the  earth  opened and  Lisbon  sank,  but  the  darkest  day since  the  creation  of  the  world  was when  the  carnage  of  Calvary  was  en­ acted.

It  was  about  noon  when  the  curtain began  to  bo  drawn. I t was  not  tho coming  on  of  a  night  that  soothes and  refreshes. It  was  the  swinging of  a  g reat  gloom  all  around  the  heav­ ens. God  hung  it. As  when  there  Is a  dead  one  In  the  house  you  bow  tho shutters  or  turn  the  lattice,  so  God  in the  afternoon  shut  tho  windows  of the  world. As  it  Is appropriate  to throw  a  black  pall  upon  the  coflin  as it  passes  along,  so  It  w as  appropriate that  everything should be somber that  day  as  the  great  hearse  of  the earth  rolled  on,  bearing  the  corpse  of the  King. A  man's  last  hours  are  or­ dinarily  kept  sacred. However  you may  have  hated  or  caricatured  a  man, when  you  hear ho  is  dying silence  puts its  hands  on  your  lips,  and  you  would have  a  loathing  for  the mau  who could  stand  by a deathbed  making faces  and  scoffing. But  Christ  in  his last  hour  cannot  bo  left  alone. What, pursuing  him  yet  after  so  long  a  pur­ suit? You  have  been  drinking  hl3 tears.  Do  you  w ant  to  d rin k   his  blood? They  come up  clossly.  so  th a t notw ith­ standing  the  darkness  they  can  glut th e ir  revenge  w ith  the  contortions  of his countenance. They  examine  his feet. They want to  feel  for  themseives whether  those  feet  are  really  spiked. They  put out  their hands and  touch the spikes  and  bring  them  back  wet  with blood  and  wipe  them  on  their  gar­ ments. Women  stand  there  and  weep, but  can  do  no  good. I t   Is  no  place  for the  tender  hearted women. It  w ants  a heart  th a t  crime  has  turned  into  gran­ ite. The  waves  of  m an's  hatred  and of  hell's vengeance  dash  up  against the  mangled  feet,  and  th*e  hands  ot sin  and  pain  and  torture  clutch  for  his holy  heart. Hud  he  not  been  thor­ oughly  fastened to the cross  they would  have  torn  him  down  and  tram ­ pled  him  with  both  feet. How  tho cavalry  horses  arched  th e ir  necks  and champed  their  bits  and  reared  and snuffed  a t  the  blood! Had  a  Roman officer  called  out  for  a  light,  his  voice would  not  have  been  heard  in  the  tu­ mult,  but  louder  than  the  clash  of spears,  and  the  wailing  of  w'omanhood, and  the  neighing  of  the  chargers,  and the  bellowing  of  the  cruciflers,  there comes  a  voice  crashing  through-loud, clear,  overwhelming,  terrific. It  is  the groaning  of  the  dying  Son  of  God! Look,  w hat  a  scene! Look,  world,  at what  you  have  done?

## DEATH'S  VISITS  IN SLEEP.

## Vie Apoplexy  Frequently  Attack*  Its

## tlms  W h ile   They  Slumber*

The  frequent  occurrence  of  apoplexy during sleep  was Illustrated in the case of  Colonel  A lbert D.  Shaw. He  had made  a  patriotic speech during the evening  and  had  retired  In  apparently good  health.  In  his  instance  there  was a  com bination  of  causes  to  bring about the  result-a  banquet,  m ental  excite­ ment,  probable  indigesetion  and  a  co­ incident  lowering  of  vital  tone. In some  respects  the  circumstances  were sim ilar  to  those  attending  the  demise of Henry  George,  who was  likewise stricken  after  forced  efforts  on the platform. Why  the  aceldcnt  in  ques­ tion  should  occur  a t  a  tim e  when  all the  bodily  functions  are  seemingly  at rest  is  n t  first  th o u g h t  som ew hat  dif­ ficult  to   explain. When,  however,  the arteries  of  the  brain  become  brittlo  by age  the  slightest  change  of  blood  pres­ sure  is  often  enough  to  precipitate i rupture  of  those  vessels  and  cause  tho escape  of  a  clot  either  upon  the  sur­ face  or  Into  the  substance  of  the  brain. High  m ental  tension,  being  always  as­ sociated  w ith  congestion,  is  in  itself an  active  predisposing cause  ot  apo­ plexy. This  condition  is  apt  to  con­ tinue  during  a  more  or  less  troubled sleep,  and  with  an  overtired  nervous system  there  Is  less  resistance  to  over stretching of  the  cerebral  arteries  than during  the  waking  hours. Nature,  in stead  of  rebounding,  sim ply  succumbs. The  fullness  of  the vessels Increases until  the  final  break  occurs. Generally the  effusion of  blood is sufficiently large  to  be  fpllowed  by  Instantaneous death,  causing one  sleep  to  pass  quiet­ ly  in to   th e   o th er. As  evidence  ot  this peaceful  ending, it  is  often noticed th a t the  patients  are  found  as  if  in natural  slumber,  com fortably  lying  on the  side,  w ith  bedclothes  undisturbed and  w ith  countenance  perfectly  calm. -New  York  Herald.

The  advance  of  cremation  in  E ng­ land,  shown  by  the  establishm ent  of a  municipal  furnace  in  the  n o rth   and the  projection  of  a  new  crem atorium not  fa r  outside  th e  four-m ile  rad iu s  In London,  recalls  the interesting his­ tory  of  Japan  In  the  m atter. Crema­ tion followed Buddhism  into Japan about  1,200  years  ago,  but  it  only  p ar­ tially  superseded  the  Shlnton  custom of  disposing  of  the  dead  by  in te rm en t In  3873  crem ation  was  totally  prohib­ ited  by the Japanese government, whose  members seem  to have had some  confused  notion  as  to  the  prac­ tice  being  un-European  and therefore barbarous. Haviug  discovered  that, far  from  being un-European, crema­ tion  was  the  goal  of  European  reform ­ ers  in  such  m atters,  they  rescinded their  prohibition  before  two  years  had elapsed. Cremation  In  Japan  is  car­ ried  out  in  a  somewhat  rough and ready  manner. The  cheapest  process only  costs  about  $1.12. This  is  scarce­ ly  adapted  to western requirem ents and is  sufficiently  described the  native cremation  grouud

by  the title  which  tfie  foreign  residents  of  a certain  settlem ent  in  Japan  gave  to among the  hills-'Roast  Meat  valley.'

## Protecting?  Forestk  from   F ir*.

Systematic  protection  of  the  forests against flre  is  an  issue  before  th e   New Jersey  legislature. The total  forest area of New Jersey is more than  2,000,000  acres,  which  is  believed  to  be  la rg ­ er  in  proportion  to  its  size  th a n   th a t of  any  other  middle  state. The  pro­ posed  preventive  m easures will  follow the  general  lines  of  a  suggestion  made by  Gifford  Pinchot,  an  authority  on forestry,  ■which  involves  a  system   of fire lanes,  to  be patrolled  dally  by wardens.

The  80,000 barm aids  of  15ngiand work  fourteen  h o u rs  :t  day. Their

## INDIAN  MISSIONARY'S  STORY.

Tears o f T o i l s o m e M in is t r y A m ong tbe C lio c t a w j .

Little  York,  Ind.,  A pril  1.-(Special).

-Twenty-five  years  ago  the  Rev.  C. H.  Thompson  left  Indiana. For  a time  he  preached  in  Arkansas,  after­ wards  entering on  the  regular mission­ ary  work  am ong  the  Choctaw  Indians.

For  five  years  he  lived  and  labored among  the  full  bloods  of  the  western prairies,  until  on  A pril  5tli,  18S5,  hav­ ing  lost  his  w ife,  he  loft  the  circuit on  which  he  had  prcached  so  long,  and commenced traveling missionary work among the Indians of the various tribes  scattered  in  the  west.

This irregular -work  involved  a great deal  of  travel  over  th e  prairies. The Jrinking  of  so  m uch alkali water, brought  on  kidney troubles which terminated  in  D iabetes.

Finally,  while  laboring  among  tho Creek  Indians a t Wagoner,  Indian Territory,  th is  noble  m an  was  strick­ en  down  completely. A  Chicago  spe­ cialist was  summoned,  and  after  a cireful  exam ination  declared  that there was  not  the  slig h te st  chance  of  his re­ covery. Besides  tho  prescriptions  of the  doctors  he  trie d   m any  other  medi­ cines,  but  all  to  no  avail. 1-Ie  says:

'I  had  concluded  th a t  my  days  were drawing  to  a  close,  w hen  I  picked  up an almanac  telling  of  the  cures  of  Dia­ betes by the  uso of Dodd's Kidney Pills. I  sent  for  two  boxes.  I  gained  strength and  spirits  from   th e  tim e  I  commenced to  use  them,  and  so  I  sen t  for  more. I am  now  completely  cured,  and  have not  the  slightest  sym ptom   of  my  old trouble.

'I  am  68  years  of  age. I  tell  every­ body  of  the  w onders  Dodd's  ICldney Pills  have  done  for me. I  can certainly endorse  them  heartily,  and  vouch  th at they  are  all  th a t  is  claim ed  for  them. They  have  certainly  been  a  God-send to  me.'

Dodd's  Kidney  Pills  are  the  only Remedy  that  has  ever  cured  Bright's Disease,  Diabetes  or  Dropsy  and  they never  fail.
