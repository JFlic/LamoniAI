These career-focused non-degree certificate programs give you a faster way to get the skills you need. Dynamic 3-hour sessions deliver lively, interactive training daily with time left in your day to put what you’ve learned into practice. You’ll reinforce learning by applying new concepts immediately on the job.

Upon completion of a comprehensive exam, you will receive a Certificate of Completion and a digital eBadge from Graceland University. (May be eligible for your company’s tuition reimbursement program. Check with your employer.)

Each virtual certificate program is a series of LIVE, online, instructor-led sessions that provide you with the essentials you need to grow your skills at an accelerated pace.

Get the essentials you need to grow your coaching skills at an accelerated pace and build a high-performing, results-oriented team who can move your organization forward.

Start your management career out right. Make sure you're equipped with the fundamental skills you need to thrive in your leadership role – and to steer your organization to success.

Your ability to communicate, easily navigate relationships and adapt your leadership style as needed is key to becoming a stellar project leader. Learn how to communicate clearly, lead with empathy, motivate your team and help team members through conflict to achieve productive completion of every project.

Expand your skill sets and widen your perspective on broader leadership and strategic challenges. Gain the essential knowledge, tactics, and confidence you need to be savvier and more effective in your leadership role.

Heighten your ability to "command a room" by mastering the communication essentials to help  you connect, influence, motivate, and open doors for your career future.

Take the guesswork out of decision-making by mastering the essential principles of people analytics. Transform your HR metrics into data-driven insights that empower you to make smarter, more strategic contributions to your organization.

Master the essential HR core competencies. From recruiting and onboarding to understanding labor laws and writing policies to helping management keep workers engaged, learn how to handle your role with greater confidence and success.

Even if you've been building skills for years, you may have only been able to tap a fraction of Excel's capabilities. Now you can advance your Excel knowledge and learn how to use the full range of its powerful features.

To thrive in today's business environment, you need to be ready for anything. That means going beyond traditional secretarial and clerical duties to master the skills that will drive your career in exciting new directions.
