# Class Attendance

Students are expected to attend classes from the first day of the term and continue to attend each scheduled class meeting, including the final exam period.

In addition, students are expected to be punctual and complete all work whether they are present in class or not.

Excused absences

Making up coursework missed due to excused absences should be negotiated between the instructor and the student, and it is the student’s responsibility to initiate the discussion.

Excused absences include the following:

All other absences are considered unexcused, including absences caused by early departures for breaks or late arrivals after breaks and absences due to athletic practices, workout sessions or meetings. In the case of an unexcused absence, the instructor is not obligated to provide an opportunity for making up coursework for credit and may levy additional penalties depending on the individual course policy.

In special situations, a course instructor or club/program advisor may also request for a student to be excused from another course or from an athletic practice so that the student can participate in an important educational activity. Excused absences from athletic practice will not result in penalties, e.g. loss of playing time, for the player.
