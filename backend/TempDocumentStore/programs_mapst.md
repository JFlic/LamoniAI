## Why Graceland's School of Social Transformation?

Graceland’s seminary schooling takes on an approach to curriculum, teaching, and the seminary’s community life that enhances and integrates the intellectual, personal, professional, and spiritual growth of students. Our peace and social transformation program includes a dynamic relationship of research, consultation, and learning with local church congregations and denominational jurisdictions at all levels. We actively proclaim a community of faith and learning inclusive of women and men who are diverse in ethnic, economic, social, and national backgrounds. We work hard to promote the preparation of Christian leaders for mission through ministries of proclamation, justice, peace and reconciliation in religious, educational, political, and public settings.

The Community of Christ Seminary at Graceland University is shaped by a strong dedication to creating a place of belonging for all people, not just those who look, think and live the way we do. Backed by a solid foundation grounded in Christianity, we believe that faith should be inclusive and welcoming — and we teach all of our courses and concentrations through the lens of this perspective.
