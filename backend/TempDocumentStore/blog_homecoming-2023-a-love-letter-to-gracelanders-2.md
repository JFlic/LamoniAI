This year’s theme, Strongly Rooted & Still Growing, celebrated Graceland’s deep history while embracing the exciting changes shaping its future, creating a beautiful bridge between alumni and current students.

Friday evening set the tone with a celebration honoring Graceland’s outstanding awardees. Alumni gathered to reflect on the generations of hard work and generosity that have made Graceland so special. The night continued with the much-lovedAir Bandcompetition, where house pairings brought movies likeShrekandThe Lion Kingto life through vibrant costumes, music, and choreography. The Morden Center echoed with cheers and hugs as alumni and students shared in the joy of this spirited tradition.

Saturday welcomed a new event, “Fun on the Quad,” where students hosted activities like face painting, bracelet-making, and games for alumni and their families. Laughter filled the air as alumni reconnected with friends and shared stories of their time at Graceland. Food trucks, Spikeball games, and the football game brought everyone together, while honor classes gathered in the evening to reminisce over desserts and yearbooks, swapping stories that felt like they had just happened yesterday.

As the sun set on a day filled with joy and connection, the campus came alive once more for Saturday night’sLEGACY: A Celebration of the Performing Arts, a heartfelt tribute to Graceland’s rich creative traditions. The event brought together Graceland’s Music and Theatre programs for an unforgettable evening honoring the past, present, and future of the performing arts. Alumni, students, and music ensembles shared the stage, filling the room with talent, passion, and nostalgia. From moving solos to vibrant group performances, the show was a testament to Graceland’s rich artistic heritage and its bright future. It was a celebration of creativity, fellowship, and the enduring spirit of the arts at Graceland.

One of the weekend’s most nostalgic moments was the return of a tradition dating back to 1941: roller skating. In the Newcom Student Union Great Room, alumni and students donned skates to relive a cherished part of Graceland’s past. Watching former Alumni Board President Holly Phillips ’81 Caskey glide effortlessly around the room, her hair blowing in the breeze and a smile lighting up her face, was like watching time fold in on itself. In that moment, Holly was both a student and an alumna, reminding us all of the timeless essence of Graceland.

The weekend ended with the Sunday Worship Service in Shaw Center’s Family Auditorium. Presiding Bishop Ron Harmon ’86 of Community of Christ offered a heartfelt blessing, filling the room with gratitude and love. As alumni departed, the warmth and connection they experienced lingered, a reminder of the deep bonds that make Graceland “home.”

Homecoming 2024 was a celebration of where we’ve been and where we’re going, leaving everyone inspired and grateful to be part of such a remarkable community.
