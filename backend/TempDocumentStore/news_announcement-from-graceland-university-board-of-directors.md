August 11, 2014

Saturday, the Graceland University Board of Trustees ended a year-long, strategic dialogue by endorsing the faculty’s decision to align the academic calendars of Graceland’s two campuses, effective with the 2015-16 academic year. The new alignment eliminates the three-week winter term, during which students have experienced service and study abroad opportunities. Board of Trustees Chair, Harry Ashenhurst, explained, “Like the Graceland faculty, the Board of Trustees considered all aspects of the change very carefully.” The board assigned a task force that engaged board members, faculty, staff and students together for nine months as they reviewed and defined each of the complex issues. The group reviewed student, alumni and faculty input, best practices in teaching and learning, American Council on Education and the American Association of Colleges and Universities research, and accreditation standards.

In a statement after the vote, Ashenhurst said, “The board and administration recognize the many aspects and memorable experiences of Winter Term. We are committed to fostering those innovative learning practices that have transformed so many students’ lives. In the future, the institution will deliberately collaborate to focus on active learning in and out of the classroom, all year round.” President Sellars added, “This change will better integrate the two campuses and will enable Graceland to offer even more robust service and study abroad experiences.”
