“Humility makes us grateful for the many kinds of support we have received that helped make possible your achievement being acknowledged and recognized by this ceremony today, and the opportunity to have a rich and rewarding life and career.”

Dennis Shields, JD, ’77

June 19, 2023 | Georgia Seagraves

It was a brisk Saturday morning on Dec. 17, 2022, as seminary and nursing students gathered at the Community of Christ Auditorium in Independence, Missouri. Community of Christ Presiding Bishop Ron Harmon Jr. ’86 addressed the crowded auditorium, and after the ceremony, the room was buzzing with excitement as graduates and their families celebrated their incredible accomplishments.

Over at the Lamoni campus, the commencement weekend began on Saturday, April 29, 2023, with the baccalaureate celebration in the Shaw Family Auditorium. Vice President for Student Life Dave Schaal ’80, announced Colby Wilken ’23 as the recipient of the Student Life Award – a testament to Wilken’s superior leadership and service to the Graceland community.

The next morning, the spring commencement ceremony was held for just the second time in the newly reconstructed Morden Center, and students donning caps and gowns eagerly awaited receiving their hard-earned degrees.

Honorary Doctorate recipients Ken ’79 and Cindy McClain.

In addition to the honoring of faculty awards and recognizing esteemed faculty emeriti (see below), commencement was marked by the conferring of honorary doctoral degrees to Ken ’79 and Cindy McClain, as recognition for their incredible service to the University and their community. Ken is an accomplished trial lawyer, and Cindy is a dynamic entrepreneur. Together, they have revitalized the historic Independence Square through their own personal investment and sweat equity. Further, they have offered internships to over 100 Graceland students throughout the years, investing over $100,000 to provide not only paid internship experience but also fully furnished housing for students. Together, Ken and Cindy have six children, all of whom attended Graceland.

Speaker Dennis Shields encouraged the Spring 2023 graduates to be transformational leaders as they move on to the rest of their life’s journey.

The event was made even more special with the presence of Graceland Board of Trustees member and Southern University President-Chancellor Dennis Shields, JD, ’77, as the distinguished commencement speaker. He challenged students around three main themes: brevity, humility, and kindness. Shields went on to share the story of his childhood spent in orphanages and foster homes, and how hundreds of good people showed him kindness and gave him a life of direction. He acknowledged the contributions of Graceland alumni Jack ’49 and Lois ’51 Braby on his formative years and ultimately, his decision to attend Graceland. “I lead [Southern University] with the values that Graceland, whether intentionally or unintentionally, helped to shape in me,” said Shields.

After Shields’ address, the moment that the graduates had been eagerly waiting for arrived — the conferral of their bachelor’s degrees. They walked across the stage one by one, beaming with pride as their names were called and they received their diplomas. The ceremony concluded with the tassel-turning tradition, symbolizing the graduates’ transition from students to alumni.
