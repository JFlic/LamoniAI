March 14, 2013

The Graceland University Performing Arts Series will present OPERA Iowa in concert on Tuesday, March 26, 2013, at 7:30 p.m. The performance will take place in Graceland University Shaw Auditorium.

PresentingThe Elixir of Loveby Gaetano Donizetti, OPERA Iowa returns to Graceland for a wonderful evening of love potions.

The Elixir of Lovemixes love, jealousy and mysterious libations! Young Nemorino is in love with the wealthy, but fickle Adina. When Sergeant Belcore also sets his sights on Adina, Nemorino turns to the visiting “doctor” Dulcamara for an “elixir of love,” guaranteed to turn Adina’s head and win her heart. Heads turn, but who wins her heart?
