February 12, 2025 | Shane Adams ’99

Graceland announced changes to its approach to admissions in the fall of 2024, particularly on the Lamoni campus, leading to a team of invigorated recruiters ready to bring the next class of Gracelanders to campus. First amongst those changes was the appointment of Kristi Hettrick ’96 as Interim Vice President for Admissions. While this is a temporary addition to her role as Vice President for Institutional Advancement, her experience aligns with the type of team that needed to be built and the skills necessary to ensure an efficient, funnel-based approach that embraces technology while honoring the relationship-building required. Shortly after she was appointed as VP, Hettrick and President Shrock hired Zack Mullins as Executive Director of Lamoni Admissions.

When Mullins first started at Graceland ten years ago, he spent time in admissions as he reinvigorated the men’s wrestling program. “Zack excels as a team-builder and has created an incredible culture for his national championship-winning wrestling team,” said Hettrick. “His tenacity and strategic thinking gave us all the confidence that he will lead this team to achieve their goals.”

With Hettrick and Mullins in place, they began the process of rebuilding a team to “win the I-35 corridor” – the stretch of interstate reaching from Kansas City up to Des Moines and all the towns in between.

“This is our best area of opportunity. Every student within 200 miles of our campus should know Graceland. We will place a significant emphasis on ensuring counselors, choir and band directors, coaches, and most importantly, students know Graceland is a unique and remarkable opportunity for personal growth, support for the whole self, and experiences that will last a lifetime.”

ZACK MULLINS, MAExecutive Director of Lamoni Admissions

Mullins hired a team of passionate Gracelanders, including several graduates, who began the onboarding process just before Thanksgiving and quickly hosted their first Visit Friday on December 6. “The team we’ve assembled brings a variety of skills only surpassed by their passion for Graceland,” said Mullins. “I cannot wait for prospective students to meet them – they’re going to love getting to know them.”

The new team members join Admissions Advisor Twong Wells ’97 and Director of Admissions Engagement and Events Eva Roberts ’16 Yelle, rounding out Lamoni admissions. Wells brings more than seven years of experience recruiting students from around the globe. Yelle manages admissions events from Visit Days and the State Fair to Community of Christ-focused events like World Conference and the summer camp program to ensure alignment and connection with our prospective legacy students.

KEVIN GROVERrecently retired after over 30 years as an educator and administrator in the Blue Springs School District. In the fall of 2024, he ran for public office and helped with the largest turnout in his district in a decade. The third of his three children, Caitlyn, is currently enrolled at Graceland like her brothers before her.

“I’ve gotten to understand the value of Graceland through their experiences, which have all been unique and rewarding to them.”

JESSICA KELSEY ’23previously worked part-time for Graceland in Institutional Advancement while she completed her degree, graduating in 2023. Before that, she had worked in elementary and secondary education as well as with the Community Services League. Her Graceland experience began in 2008 before she took a break to focus on her family. When she returned, she found that her experience showed her firsthand how Graceland meets students where they are and helps them achieve their goals, no matter their path.

“I want people to know that Graceland isn’t just a university, it’s a community where students are supported academically, socially, and emotionally, and where lifelong friendships are formed.”

JILLIAN KILLPACK ’21worked in the mental health field in Maryland before recently relocating back to Missouri. Jillian was a house president, and her family has deep roots at Graceland — her grandmother is residence life legend Marian Killpack.

“I learned so much about myself at Graceland: how to be a leader, and most importantly that at the root of it all, building relationships is the key.”

JACK MAIN ’24spent the summer interning with the McClain group in Independence. He also finished the demo for the video game he began as a senior at Graceland, entitled “The Tenebris Chronicles.” Main is excited to share his passion for the Graceland Experience, which saw him as a House President of Tiona as well as the founder of the Board Game Club that initially focused onDungeons & Dragonsbut expanded to include other board games this year.

“I want to make sure as many people as possible know how Graceland helps people become the best versions of themselves that they can be.”

DOUG ROBERTS ’02returns to the admissions team, having spent time working to recruit nursing students in Independence. While he has spent most of the last 13 years as a stay-at-home dad, he has served on Graceland’s Alumni Board of Directors and been the co-director of Spectacular for the past 10 years. Roberts played basketball for the Yellowjackets while attending Graceland.

“Graceland offers students a lot of what they are looking for even if they don’t know it – things like belonging, a welcoming community, a place where they have the opportunities to learn and grow in a safe yet challenging environment.”

MARIA METCALFis a seasoned professional when it comes to coordinating international students, having spent five years in that role at several community colleges in Ohio. She relocated to Lamoni and joined Graceland as the Director of International Recruiting in late January. She has a passion for helping orient international students into a campus community and life in the United States. Maria is completing her second master’s degree in global affairs and holds an MEd in Teacher Leadership. She is an avid reader and quilter and is excited to bring international students to Iowa for the full Graceland Experience.

Not only does Graceland have the lowest tuition of any private university in Iowa, our undergraduates get a second major in Transformational Leadership.

### The Yellow Jackets

During Homecoming 2023, eight remarkable women gathered in the Higdon Administration Building to embark on a new journey of empowerment.
