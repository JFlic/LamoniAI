Graceland’s student body is diverse.There are students who represent areas from all over the country and all over the world. They bring a wide range of curiosities and decide on many different areas of study to guide them in their future. Graceland’s student-centered focus considers all of these different cultures, backgrounds, religious preferences and interests, and still seeks to create learning communities in which all students — no matter their similarities or differences — have the opportunity to develop their potential for full and meaningful lives for the betterment of the world.

“At Graceland, being student-focused does not mean that we see students as mere objects of our efforts. Rather, being student-focused means that we understand students to be participants in the process of creativity, transition and mission. In other words, it means that Graceland seeks to help students be ready to take on the world — through what they learn, what they experience and how they engage in meaningful study and action.

Facilities

The renovation plans of the Memorial Student Center (MSC) to Newcom Student Union were developed with student input.

Closson Centeris next in line, and updates to arguably the most unique building on the Lamoni campus will revamp the most used building on campus for today’s students and the student of the future. Watch for more information on the updates to come to Closson Center.

Programs

A desire to provide opportunities for involvement to a diverse group of students with diverse interests has led to Graceland’s firstesportsteam, available for Lamoni-campus students.

Even more widespread and as a replacement for the “general education” every Lamoni-campus student receives, theessential education curriculumis designed to prepare students for a life of inquiry, analysis, discovery, problem solving, effective communication and innovation — a program to meet the needs and desires of today’s students.

Services

As of this fall, students on the Lamoni campus have a one-stop shop for many student services aimed to help them succeed. Among other services available in the Student Success Studio, this collaborative effort includes tutoring, the Writing Center, peer mentors, disability services and career services.

Independence-campus nursing students were offered an ATI testing strategies seminar earlier this term designed to help them prepare for the NCLEX-RN licensure exam. Graceland strongly believes in supporting students on their educational journey both in and out of the classroom.

Community

Marissa Meyer ’18 landed a job with AmeriCorps in Anchorage, Alaska, in less than just two weeks by reaching out to theGU4U Graceland alumni network, a committee sponsored by the Graceland Alumni Board that builds relationships between current students and past graduates. “I couldn’t be more excited, and it’s all thanks to the advice and support of the Graceland community!,” said Marissa. The Power of Together in action.

September 9, 2018

An exciting change is coming to the Graceland University Lamoni campus.As the university continues to emphasize the idea of a student-centered environment, it is appropriate that the Memorial Student Center (MSC), a building that is so much a part of every student’s life, should receive major renovations that will greatly impact students and their Graceland experience.
