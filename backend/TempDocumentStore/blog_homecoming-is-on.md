Graceland sons and daughters all…

With less than a month to go, we have decided to move forward with a modified IN PERSONHomecomingthis year!

We know that you are all anxious to gathertogether againin Lamoni and celebrate the honor classes of the past two years. This year will look a little different as we are still placing a high emphasis on the health and safety of our students, our campus community and our alumni. Some events will be held outside or with limited attendance.

The traditional Students will take place in many of the activities throughout Homecoming weekend, but this is one major change we wanted to bring to your attention. The full schedule can be viewedon the Graceland website.

To further emphasize the safety of our students, we are asking that only those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 attend Homecoming this year. Our campuses have done an admirable job of preventing widespread infection and we want to ensure the health and safety of our students more than anything. We strongly encourage all those attending Homecoming to do so only if they have been fully vaccinated.

The Homecoming Play will be held in the Shaw Family Auditorium on Thursday and Friday at 7:30 p.m. and at 2 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. This year’s production is directed by Graceland graduate Todd Davison ’87 and is calledThe Great American Trailer Park Musical.The production is an all-American musical odyssey, exploring the relationships between the tenants of the Armadillo Acres Trailer Park in Starke, Florida. Tickets are available by calling the box office at 641.784.5296. There will also be a music showcase on Saturday evening at 7:30 p.m. in the Shaw Family Auditorium. Tickets to that performance are available here.We anticipate reaching capacity limits on these events so please plan to secure tickets to either or both shows ahead of time.

The last day to register for the Friday “Alumni Awards Banquet” and the Saturday “Honor Class” dinner is September 30. You can make dinner reservationson the Graceland website. Again, in the interest of public health and student and campus safety, these dinners will be limited in attendance to help limit potential spread of the coronavirus. You must have tickets to these events ahead of your arrival on campus. If you need assistance, please call 1.866.484.3837 (866.GU4.EVER).

If you are not going to make plans to be with us in person this year, we invite you to show your support of Graceland and plan to wear your best blue and gold Graceland gear on Saturday, October 16 and tag us in your pictures onFacebook,Instagram, orTwitter. The unwavering support of our alumni and friends has carried this community over the past year and we are grateful for your presence both in person and online.
