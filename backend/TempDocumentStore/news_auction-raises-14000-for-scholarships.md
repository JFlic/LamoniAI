On Nov. 8, the C.H. Sandage School of Business sponsored the Fourth Annual Scholarship Auction in the Shaw Center on Graceland’s Lamoni campus. The Agricultural Business Scholarship Auction is an annual event that raises funds to support the Bruch Family Agricultural Business Scholarship Fund, named for the late Robert Page Bruch, a longtime Graceland supporter. The theme, “Global Agricultural Professionals”, reflects the students’ desire to contribute to the global community. From managing in the international marketplace to feeding the world’s population, students have the potential to effect global changes in agriculture.

The evening began informally in the Shaw Center lobby with a dinner and silent auction. President Sellars formally kicked off the event in Carol Hall by recognizing longtime Graceland agricultural business supporters Leonard and Dody Boswell, Jack and Phillis Davison, and Dave and Karen Jewell.

President Sellars’ introduction was followed by the main event of the evening, the live auction, auctioneered by former Iowa Democratic Congressman and Graceland alum Leonard Boswell. Boswell shared stories about Bob Bruch, founder of Graceland College’s agri-business curriculum in the 1980s. Despite the fact that Boswell is a Democrat, the staunchly Republican Bruch acted as Boswell’s first campaign manager. Boswell’s take on this was “you can work together if youwantto!”

This year, the featured auction items were a six-night stay at the Lake of the Ozarks cabin and a three-day hunting package. Several students donated their own labor and were ‘sold’ at the auction; others baked cakes and pies or offered golf lessons.

“We are so appreciative of our supporters’ generosity. The scholarships will make the difference for many of our current and future Agricultural Business students,” said Max Pitt, Assistant Professor of Business.
