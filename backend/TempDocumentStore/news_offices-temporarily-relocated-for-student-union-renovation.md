Looking north from the Lamoni campus quad to the renovation project that will become Newcom Student Union

The Memorial Student Center has housed many offices and services over the nearly seven decades it has served the needs of the Graceland Lamoni campus, including several Student Life departmental offices, the bookstore, the post office and the Swarm Inn.

Until the renovation of the Newcom Student Union is complete, students and visitors still need to visit these offices to access their services. Below you will find a listing of the offices and services that have been relocated and where to find them.
