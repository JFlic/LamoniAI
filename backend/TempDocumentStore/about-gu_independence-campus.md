Graceland’s Missouri Home Since 1969. For over 50 years, we have been offering students an excellent education through our nationally acclaimed Graceland University School of Nursing at our commuter campus in Independence, Missouri located just 20 minutes from Kansas City, Missouri. Since the nursing school opened in 1969, we’ve added a number of other face-to-face undergraduate and graduate programs in education, business and seminary, as well as many online master’s programs, which are also run out of our Independence campus.
