Graceland University announced Monday that it would not require ACT and SAT testing for students applying to its undergraduate programs for the Fall 2020 semester.

“One of our most important values at Graceland is community, and communities around the world are struggling,” said Graceland President Patricia H. Draves. “Just one of the many challenges now facing students applying for college is that standardized test dates are being canceled due to COVID-19, preventing them from taking the tests and providing scores for college admission. We felt it was important to take this step to ensure those seeking to gain college entry in the fall have every opportunity to pursue their education.”

Graceland also adjusted the requirements for international students and will not require the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) for Fall 2020 admission because most international test sites have closed due to fears of the virus. Graceland will instead evaluate English language skills through a virtual face-to-face interview and other written and oral assessments conducted by faculty and staff.

These changes add to Graceland’s already flexible and student-friendly admissions process. Prospective Graceland students also enjoy no application fees, no out-of-state tuition rate, and no deadline for applying or paying their deposit.

“We are thrilled to assist students and families at this time and welcome future Yellowjackets to this outstanding community,” said Deb Skinner, Graceland Dean of Undergraduate Admissions.
