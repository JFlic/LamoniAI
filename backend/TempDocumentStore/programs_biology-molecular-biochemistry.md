Molecular and Biochemistry is one of two concentrations available under Graceland’s biology major. A biochemistry and molecular Biology major will set you up for success in several scientific fields.

Biology: Molecular & Biochemistry is one of two Biology tracks Graceland offers. This track, in the same way as a singular Molecular biology degree or a biochemistry degree, often leads students to careers in the health sciences (medicine, dentistry, physician assistant, physical therapy, etc.), microbiology, and immunology. We offer a comprehensive active-learning approach to our biology degree which prepares students well for their post-graduate careers.With such a wide field of knowledge in general biology and the specifics of biochemistry and molecular biology, students have a large variety of choices when it comes to post-graduate careers. Some students enter careers immediately after graduation as teachers, laboratory technicians, and pharmaceutical sales representatives. Others go on to post-graduate studies in medical, dental, physician assistant, physical therapy, and pharmacy. Graceland offers several graduate programs that would pair well with a student who had recently graduated as a biochemistry and molecular biology major.
