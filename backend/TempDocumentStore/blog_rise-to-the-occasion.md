# Rise to the Occasion: Teamwork | Graceland

By staying disciplined and playing together, they would do great things.

March 19, 2018

As each game progressed, one unexpected win after the next, Graceland’s secret sauce would slowly be exposed to the world. On paper, there were more talented and experienced teams in the tournament. But Coach Doty and his staff preached repeatedly that despite the odds being against them, by staying disciplined and playing together, they would do great things. And that they did.

-Scott Thompson, Honorary Coach

“I had a first row seat for the entire men’s basketball season, and what a season it was. The student-athletes and coaches on this team taught us what is possible with hard work, determination, trust, attention to detail and teamwork. Witnessing their behavior on and off the court was a gift. Their kindness and humility, while being intensely competitive and committed to the excellence needed for a national championship, are models for our everyday work.”

President Draves, Graceland University

Coach Doty remarked, “Our bench from top to bottom was committed to helping each other. This is the toughest national tournament to win in all of college basketball, as we had to win five games in six days to win it all. Thanks to my staff for staying up until 3 a.m. preparing scouting reports, thanks to my administration, and thanks to our students and fans, who single-handedly changed the culture of our program from the stands.”

I have had good experiences with some of the assistants of the mens’ basketball team–Ben Kluzak has really stood out in the classroom, taking initiative and being enthusiastic about learning; Ron Keller I just met in sports psych–impressed by his professionalism; same for Dylan Martin (sports psych); Teddy Palmer was an INTD student of mine a while back and a good team player in the classroom. Quality all through the staff.

– Dave Devonis, PhDProfessor of Psychology

Coach Doty and players were recognized for their outstanding performance — after a season of working together to overcome adversity and achieve victory.

Deemer, a senior center from Lamoni, IA, shot 61.4 percent (27-of-44) in the tournament. He averaged 13.8 ppg and recorded a double-double in all five games of the tournament.

He highlights his appreciation for the support of his wife, Alexys, and son, Braylon, who have traveled the national championship road with him each time.

“Our commitment is to maintain a competitive men’s basketball program that is focused on recruiting, retaining and graduating the best student-athletes in the nation. Working together with Doty, we won a conference and national championship in only his second year.As we move forward, there is confidencethat the future is bright.”Scott Briell VP for Enrollment Management
