November 12, 2018

David Siddall joins Graceland University as the next Vice President for Business Finance serving as chief financial officer and leader of business operations. After a diligent and collaborative process and review of more than 60 applications, the search committee determined Siddall to be the right fit for the evolution of Graceland. He brings new skills and ways of thinking with extensive expertise in business, finance and law.

An 1985 Graceland graduate, Siddall earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration with an emphasis in accounting and continued his studies completing a juris doctorate from the University of Iowa College of Law. After 25 years, he returned to college and earned a Master of Law (LLM), an internationally recognized advanced law certification in estate planning, from the University of Miami School of Law.

During his career, Siddall has been vice president at two major energy companies, owner of a law firm and has a lifelong record of volunteer service. His expansive knowledge comprises corporate governance, securities and finance, compliance and ethics, human resources, employee benefits, real estate, mergers, intellectual property, exploration and production, business operations, budgets exceeding $150 million, and management of relationships with diverse types of people, many with specialized knowledge.

Siddall’s commitment to the liberal arts, open style, intellect, critical thinking ability and diverse experience will serve as a good foundation for him as he begins a new adventure in higher education. He has reflected his dexterity in what are the top priorities for the role of vice president of business and finance: a commitment to Graceland’s mission, demonstrated ability to manage a variety of important university areas, experience and knowledge enough to be a strategic finance partner with the president, and an innovative thought leader who can help Graceland get to the next level.

Growing up in Lamoni with six siblings, Siddall’s father served nearly 20 years as a member of Graceland’s housekeeping staff, and Siddall himself held his first job as a teen and college student working for Graceland’s facility services.

Siddall returns to “the Hill” and joins the Graceland staff full time beginning Nov. 12. His primary office will be located on the Independence campus and he will maintain a weekly presence in the Higdon Administration Building on the Lamoni campus.
