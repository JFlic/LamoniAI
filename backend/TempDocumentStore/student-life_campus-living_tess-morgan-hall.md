The hall is named in recognition of the Graceland faculty member who taught English for 33 years and served as dean of women.

Tess Morgan Hall consists of three wings: the south one completed in 1960 and the other two completed in 1967. In 1959, the Campus Planning Committee recommended that the structure be named Tess Morgan Hall in recognition of the Graceland faculty member who taught English for 33 years and served as dean of women.
