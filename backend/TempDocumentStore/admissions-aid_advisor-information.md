Save Your Spot for Fall 2025 on the Lamoni Campus

Your Admissions Advisor is often the first person you meet from Graceland University.

We want to make your transition to Graceland University as easy as possible!

We are here to help guide you through the admissions and financial aid process. Whether it is arranging a campus visit for you and your family, scheduling appointments for you to talk about your academic or athletic interests with professors and coaches or describing our unique residential house system, when you have questions, your Admissions Advisor can find the answers.

Give us a call or email, and we will get back to you right away. We look forward to working with you.
