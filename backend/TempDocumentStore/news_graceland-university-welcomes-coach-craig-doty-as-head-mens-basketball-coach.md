Graceland University is excited to announce the hiring of Craig Doty as Head Coach for the Graceland Men’s Basketball program. Doty officially began his coaching role with Graceland on Monday, May 16. He will maintain connections to his new team throughout the summer months and be actively recruiting for the 2016-17 season.

A native of Alcester, South Dakota, Doty attended and played basketball for Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, where he earned a bachelor’s degree with a major in English and minor in business administration, and later served as an assistant coach. He then held coaching roles at Riverland Community College in Minnesota and the University of Sioux Falls in South Dakota before taking on the Head Coach role at Rock Valley College in Rockford, Illinois, in 2012.

Prior to accepting the position with Graceland, Doty spent four years at Rock Valley, a National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) school, where he led the team to four consecutive national tournaments and two national titles. Doty earned the title of NJCAA Coach of the Year in 2014 and compiled a record of 113-28 during his time at Rock Valley College, holding the #1 rank in the country for 728 consecutive days.

Coach Doty looks to build on a successful 2016-17 season for the Yellowjackets, who made the HAAC semi-finals and ended the 2015-16 season with a 17-15 record.

“I am thrilled to be joining the Graceland University family,” commented Doty. “When you step foot on the beautiful Lamoni, Iowa, campus, you instantly feel the ‘family-first’ culture. The opportunity to be the head coach at a prestigious academic institution in the Heart of America Athletic Conference was too good to pass up. My family and I are excited to make the move back to Iowa, a state where I have spent many years of my life”

“We are extremely excited to welcome Craig Doty, a tremendously successful NJCAA coach, to the Yellowjacket Athletics family, said Graceland University Athletic Director, Joe Worlund.“Craigshares our athletic program’s values. His energy and competitiveness are unmistakable, but his commitment to the academic and personal development of our student-athletes will be second to none. We have full confidence in Craig’s leadership and look forward to a new era of Yellowjacket Basketball under his guidance.”
