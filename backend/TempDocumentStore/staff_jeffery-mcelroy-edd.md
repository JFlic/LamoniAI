Jeffery W. McElroy, EdD, is Dean of Graceland University’s C.H. Sandage School of Business and Associate Professor of Business Administration. He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration and Economics from Graceland University, an MBA from Drake University, a Doctorate of Education in Leadership from Drake University and is a Sam Walton Fellow.

McElroy’s philosophy of teaching stems from his expertise in marketing, customer service, field service and operations after 20+ years in corporate management, which enables him to bring real-world examples to the classroom. His goal is to provide students with as much information and experiential learning as possible. He wants them to be better prepared than their peers from other institutions and be more successful in their chosen careers. To accomplish this, McElroy incorporates a myriad of styles and activities in the classroom such as current events, lectures with power points, videos, learning games, simulations, clickers, group activities, open discussion, real-world examples and real-life case studies. Experiential learning includes industry-leading guest speakers, trips to tour companies, real-world applications such as Kaizen and Microsoft Project, and the opportunity to develop and implement real marketing plans with local and Fortune 500 companies.
