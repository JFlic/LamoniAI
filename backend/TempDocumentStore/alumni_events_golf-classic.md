WinterStone Golf Course opened in 2003 in Independence, Missouri. It is the second phase in a development project that began with a limestone mine. Harlan Limpus, owner of the mining firm Rocca Processing, bought 150 acres of land and opened a mine there in 2000. Limpus then built a golf course on the property to enhance the value to the community in 2003. But not just a golf course, a great golf course, because the wooded setting is truly spectacular with elevation changes, towering trees, lakes and creeks combining to create an Ozarks-like feel. The course was designed by Craig Schreiner Golf Course Architects, a local firm with a national reputation.

Please wear proper golf attire and soft spikes only.
