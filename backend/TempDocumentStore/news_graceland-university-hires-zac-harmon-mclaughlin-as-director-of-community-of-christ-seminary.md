Graceland University is proud to announce the hiring of Zac Harmon-McLaughlin as Director of the Community of Christ Seminary.

Harmon-McLaughlin received his Bachelor of Arts in Religion in 2008 and his Master of Arts in Religion in 2010 – both from Graceland. In 2019, he will complete his Doctorate of Ministry in Executive Leadership at the San Francisco Theological Seminary. As a Graceland Seminary alumnus, he is uniquely equipped to offer his experience, skills and deep connection to Community of Christ, the university’s sponsoring church. Most recently, Harmon-McLaughlin was the Regional Development Executive Director for Community of Christ in Northern California and Western Nevada.

“We are thrilled about the passion that Zac brings to the seminary. We had many qualified candidates, but his zeal for religious education, his experience as a leader, and his connection and commitment to Community of Christ set him apart,” said Patricia H. Draves, Graceland University President.

Harmon-McLaughlin will lead the Community of Christ Seminary at Graceland University, which was founded in 2002 as a joint venture between Graceland University and the sponsoring church, Community of Christ.

“The Community of Christ Seminary fulfills a critical role in meeting the church’s mission initiative to develop disciples to serve,” said Stassi Cramm, member of the Community of Christ First Presidency and Graceland Board of Trustees member. “We are excited by Zac’s selection as the new seminary director and look forward to his leadership and ministry in this important role. We are grateful for the church’s partnership with Graceland University that makes all of this possible.”

At the seminary, students receive the best theological scholarship available, paired with personal and communal faith formation. It is the intellectual and sacred gathering space that embodies the profound and enduring relationship between the university and the church.

“I’m humbled and honored to return to Graceland to serve as the director of the seminary,” shared Harmon-McLaughlin. “I’m looking forward to engaging in leadership development and practical ministerial application through religious education. My deep hope is to empower and inspire future innovative leaders and ministers to cultivate and create authentic, loving and transformative Christian community.”

Harmon-McLaughlin will start at Graceland in March 2019 and will split his time between the Independence and Lamoni campuses.
