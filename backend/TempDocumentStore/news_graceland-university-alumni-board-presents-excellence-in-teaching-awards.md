June 3, 2014

While recognizing the success of students each spring, Graceland University’s commencement provides an opportunity to give recognition for outstanding accomplishments in the Graceland community. This year, the Graceland Alumni Board of Directors Sam Smalldon awarded Nancy Wallace and Thelma Sword the Excellence in Teaching Award. The award carries with it a $1,000 check to be used on educational improvement and professional development. This was the first year two awards were given; one for the Lamoni campus and one for the Independence campus of Graceland University. In addition, a Special Recognition Award was presented to Peggy Henson for her seven years of teaching excellence at Graceland University.

“What is most impressive about Nancy is her ceaseless patience and endless compassion for her students. She is always willing to work hard, putting in many extra hours to help us learn.” –Lynley Closson, student

“I would describe Dr. Sword as a ‘master educator’ who consistently emulates scholarship, professionalism, commitment and caring. She has the ability to motivate students to achieve both academic excellence and personal success.” -Mark Priola, RN, CRNO, MSM/NEd, FNP-C

“Mrs. Henson has been a teacher who encouraged, stirred, led, followed and helped me develop as a student, future educator, mother and person. Being in the classroom with Peggy has provided me with some of the most inspiring moments of my life.” -Leslie Niebauer, student

Graceland is grateful for these outstanding educators and the dedication they have demonstrated to ensure student success. They are examples of the passion our faculty brings to the educational and developmental experience of our students, which enables Graceland to stand out as a great university.
