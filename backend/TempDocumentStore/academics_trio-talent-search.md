# TRIO Talent Search | Graceland

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/academics/trio-talent-search/#top

TRIO Talent Search (TS) is 100 percent federally funded by a grant from the United States Department of Education in the amount of a $448,860 per year. TS provides 778 eligible participants in southern Iowa and northern Missouri with services that will help them enroll in and graduate from an institution of higher learning. The emphasis is to provide educational activities and support that promotes success in education.

The mission of the Graceland University TRIO Talent Search program is to provide underrepresented students with the tools, skills and motivation to succeed in post-secondary education.

TRIO is educational opportunity for low-income and disabled Americans.

Our nation has asserted a commitment to providing educational opportunity for all Americans regardless of race, ethnic background or economic circumstance.

In support of this commitment, Congress established a series of programs to help low-income Americans enter college, graduate and move on to participate more fully in America’s economic and social life. These programs are funded under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and are referred to as the TRIO Programs (initially just three programs). While student financial aid programs help students overcome financial barriers to higher education, TRIO programs help students overcome class, social and cultural barriers to higher education
