Graceland University President Patricia H. Draves welcomedIowa Governor Kim ReynoldsandLieutenant Governor Adam Greggto the Lamoni campus today during the Decatur County stop on their 99-county tour of the state. A small group of students and faculty were honored to have the opportunity to meet with them.

The group began their visit with a meeting with Graceland Interim Vice President of Academic Affairs Brian White, Vice President of Student Life Dave Schaal, and Graceland Director of Government Relations Tom Morain, who all offered an overview of their respective areas of Graceland.

Schaal presented an impression of the campus and the idea that the Lamoni, Iowa, campus is “in the middle of everywhere,” as we bring students from all over the country and the world with the goal to send them back out into the world with the skills to make it a better place. White discussed the change in Graceland’s core curriculum this year to anEssential Educationprogram that addresses the needs of employers, and how many Graceland programs help students to develop these skills. Morain addressed involvement of the campus and local community and how Graceland’s AmeriCorps program and others are mirroring the educational goals of Graceland in the six-county region the programs represent.

The guests next met with groups of students who represented Graceland Student Government,Graceland Enactus, theAgricultural Business program, and students who receive theIowa Tuition Grantto come to Graceland, awarded to Iowa residents enrolled at one of Iowa’s eligible private colleges or universities, including Graceland. Individual students were able to share how Graceland has impacted them and how Iowa has been important to their college experience as well.

The governor and lieutenant governor were offered a tour of the campus and received personal accounts from Professor of Theatre Dr. Gary Heisserer in Shaw Center, the university’s performing arts facility, and Professors of Chemistry Dr. Dan Pratt and Dr. Jeff Draves of Resch Science and Technology Hall, two of Graceland’s recently-renovated buildings.

President Draves and Graceland are honored to have hosted Governor Reynolds and Lieutenant Governor Gregg for this stop on their 99-county tour.
