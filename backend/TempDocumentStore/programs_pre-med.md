# Pre-Med Program

Get ready for medical school with Graceland’s pre-med program. Explore your options for undergraduate degrees that will prepare you well for your careers. This is a pre-professional program.

If you're interested in becoming a doctor, it's important to start preparing early in your college career. During your first four years of college, you'll be working toward earning your bachelor's degree in several fields. At Graceland University, we recommend those who are looking to pursue a Doctor of Medicine or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine to major in Biology or Chemistry.Since a doctorate is your end goal, we'll enroll you as a pre-med student. With these programs, you can fulfill certain requirements that will help you get into medical school. Pre-med programs are not specific majors, they are collections of pre-med courses and pre-med curriculum designed to increase your chances of getting into medical school. These specialized courses help you prepare for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT).Below you'll find more information about our course offerings and other pre-med requirements.

Students interested in pursuing a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree should major inBiologyorChemistry(with a Biology minor). For the best preparation, we recommend a double major in both Biology and Chemistry. Students should review the admissions requirements for the professional schools of their choice. We recommend that students complete the following courses (along with the requirements for a major in Biology, Chemistry, or both ) for preparation for admission and success in medical school:

During summers of their freshman and sophomore year, students should consider shadowing or volunteer experiences at local hospitals, clinics, or private practices to gain practical experience. Some programs require clinical hours. During the summer of their junior year students should participate in internships. Most students take the MCAT (medicine) exam early spring of the year they will apply. Most applications open in early summer and are rolling applications. Competitive applicants will submit their application within a week or two of the application opening. Many programs have centralized application processes that include: AMCAS (medicine), AADSAS (dentistry), OptomCAS (optometry), CASPA (PA). Students are encouraged to research individual program requirements early to ensure they can be incorporated into their schedules.

Students will learn about immunology, bacteriology, mycology, and virology. Emphasis will be placed on the cellular mechanism and role of microbial pathogens (bacteria) and agents (viruses, prions) affecting human health and how they are treated. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: BIOL2100 or instructor's consent.

A study of cellular processes involved in the Central Dogma: DNA replication, transcription and translation. The study will include how gene expression is regulated at various levels, such as at the transcription level and post-translational level. Lastly students will study and perform different molecular genetic techniques used in laboratories today: pipetting, DNA gel electrophoresis, PCR and DNA cloning. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: BIOL2100 (C or better strongly recommended). +This course is only offered every other year.

A study of gross human anatomy utilizing charts, three dimensional models, computer simulations, and dissection of mammalian animals. The course will discuss regional and surface anatomy to establish the relationships of the various organ systems of the body. Additional fee required. Prerequisites: BIOL2100 or PHED1500.

A systems oriented study of the function of the human body on the cellular, tissue, organ, and organ-system levels with an emphasis on medical physiology. Laboratory includes computer simulations and use of Biopac equipment. Additional fee required. Prerequisites: BIOL3420 (grade of C or better strongly recommended) and one semester of chemistry or BIOL2100.

An introduction to biologically important molecules and metabolic pathways and the laboratory techniques used to study and characterize them. Additional fee required. Prerequisite: CHEM3420/3421 and BIOL2100. +This course is only offered every other year.

Investigation of the innate and adaptive immune system, including inflammation, B and T cell development and function, immunization and its role in human health. Prerequisites: BIOL2100 and BIOL2360 (grade of C or better strongly recommended). +This course is only offered every other year.

Students will investigate the cellular mechanisms of cancer and then will learn about a few specific cancers. Includes an in-depth study of the multistage model of carcinogenesis, genes involved in cancer, activation of cancer genes, signal transduction pathways that promote carcinogenesis, the mechanism of metastasis, apoptosis, how cancer treatments work, and the new potential cancer treatments. Prerequisite: BIOL2100 (grade of C or better strongly recommended). 

+This course is only offered every other year.

Data analysis and measures of central tendency, dispersion, and correlation. Introduction to probability. Estimation and hypothesis testing. Bivariate regression. ANOVA. Introduction to nonparametric techniques. ELO6 Math, GE2B Foundational Skills-Mathematics/Quantitative.

Limits, continuity, differentiation, and applications including exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse functions. Mean value theorem, curve sketching, Riemann sums, and the fundamental theorem of calculus. Prerequisite: 2 years high school algebra. ELO6 Math, GE2B Foundational Skills-Mathematics/Quantitative.
