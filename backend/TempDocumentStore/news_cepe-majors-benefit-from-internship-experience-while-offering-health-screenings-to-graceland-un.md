During the Spring 2015 semester, Corrective Exercise and Performance Enhancement interns, supervised by Chad McDole in the Division of Health & Movement Sciences, are offering members of the Graceland community an opportunity to achieve their optimal level of health. The interns are providing movement screenings and developing individualized exercise programs specialized for participants based on movement screening results and personal goals. The foundation of the program is to improve the way individuals sit, stand and move, and to impact their quality of life on a daily basis.

“I’m really excited about what this internship can do for the Graceland community. I mean, what’s better than creating a healthier and happier environment? I’m also excited to expand my knowledge and gain experience working with clients on a one-on-one level, and seeing direct results from my input! This internship can help me to pass on my knowledge of wellness to peers and faculty and, in turn, they can share that knowledge with others as well,“ says Graceland junior Evan Kisner.

The Corrective Exercise and Performance Enhancement (CEPE) major at Graceland University replaced the wellness major in the fall of 2013. The major has been redesigned to further prepare students for careers in personal training, strength and conditioning, and coaching, and gives students the knowledge and skills to asses and restore musculoskeletal function and enhance human performance.

Referring to the internship program being offered at the Fitz, Chad McDole stated, “This is a win/win for our students and the Graceland community. The interns receive valuable experience and the community benefits from mentors who are invested in helping them develop a plan for better health with specific needs at no charge!”

The interns are available in the Fitz center Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 4-6 p.m. and 8-10 p.m., and on Thursdays from 9-11 a.m. If you are interested in a screening and taking part in this beneficial service but are unable to make one of the above times work into your schedule, appointments can be made by contacting Chad McDole at cmcdole@graceland.edu or 641-784-5081.
