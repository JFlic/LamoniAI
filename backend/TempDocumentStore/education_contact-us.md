Save Your Spot for Fall 2025 on the Lamoni Campus

More than just a dot on a map or a pit stop on the way to your future, Graceland is an experience. It’s a place where passionate, open-minded, dedicated and caring students, faculty and staff come to build a community that will help change the world — and has since 1895.

At Graceland, we mold professionals, entrepreneurs, creatives, and performers. For 125 years our students have become leaders in their industries. Starting in 2022, students who graduate with a 4-year degree will take with them at least two majors — one or more within their discipline and one intransformational leadership. With it, you can continue that tradition of leadership as you venture out into the world prepared and ready to change it for the better.

We’ve educated nursing students for over 50 years — that’s 50 years of experience molding the future of healthcare professionals in our country, 50 years of teaching healthcare in a graduate setting, and 50 years of shaping the way nurses are taught in a University setting. Our class sizes are small and personal, allowing for more one-on-one learning with world-class faculty and professionals. With start dates offered four times a year, students are given the opportunity to start their graduate nursing education whenever they are ready. Explore our programming to see which graduate nursing path is right for you.

With over 30 areas of study, including seven pre-professional programs, 21 undergrad majors, five master’s degrees and a Doctor of Nursing Practice degree, at Graceland, you’ll be sure to find a direction that’s right for you in one of our undergraduate, graduate and online programs. Not sure what you want to pursue? That’s okay! Take the quiz below and discover how your interests match Graceland’s academic offerings.

With our generous scholarships and awards, you’ll find a truly affordable private education at Graceland. In many cases, the cost of attending Graceland is comparable to that of a public state school.
