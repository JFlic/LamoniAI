The Graceland University C.H. Sandage School of Business and MBA Research’s High School of Business™ have reached a partnership agreement that will offer expanded services to students participating in accelerated high school business programs across the country.

The agreement gives students nationwide the opportunity to earn 12 semester hours of Graceland University credit if their high school participates in the national program, High School of Business™. Additionally, Graceland has added an additional incentive for students: a commitment that the total amount of scholarships will cover 50% of participating students’ tuition to the university, should they enroll full-time in Lamoni, Iowa.

“We are so excited to partner with the High School of Business™ on this initiative that will showcase Graceland’s nationally recognized business programs to students across the United States,” said Jeffery W. McElroy, EdD, Dean of Graceland’s C.H. Sandage School of Business. “Graceland’s business department provides students with an innovative education filled with real-world experiences. Partnering with the High School of Business™ to showcase our innovation just makes sense.”

The High School Business™ is a college-like high school business program. Over 6,500 students are enrolled in the program nationwide with over 80 participating high schools. The hands-on program prepares students to excel in college business administration programs, like those offered at Graceland University. High School of Business™ students dive into real projects via project-based learning – an educational method in which students learn concepts while completing projects that often involve collaboration with local businesses.

“By offering High School of Business™ students 12 credit hours as well as a scholarship opportunity, Graceland believes that participants have the ability to take advantage of an amazing opportunity that will prepare them for a successful career,” said McElroy.

A list of high schools participating in the High School of Business™program is available on their website. Ask your high school guidance counselor for more information on how to enroll.
