Graceland’s certified good boy and therapy dog held a birthday pawty for all of his campus furiends.

Students, staff and faculty on the Lamoni campus gladly followed the invitation of mental health specialist Carl and his human assistant Lisa Prosser-Dodds, PhD, to briefly pause/paws on the busy way to and from the classrooms and offices – and celebrate Carl’s 2nd birthday together.
