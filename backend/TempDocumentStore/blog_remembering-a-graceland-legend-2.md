Brad Carr ’91 first became a member of the Graceland University family in 1983 when he was hired as the Head Resident for Gunsolley Hall.

He soon married Sharon McKiddie and eventually left Graceland and Lamoni for an opportunity in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1989, but the impact he made on Graceland — and that Graceland had on him — had already been set in motion, and Brad would return to touch thousands of lives.

Brad rejoined Graceland as a Personal Counseling Specialist in 1991, and then, in 1995, he began his service as Director of Student Activities; a role that would prove to be a perfect fit. Brad used his creativity and imagination to provide fun and safe activities for all Graceland Lamoni campus students — and his charisma lent itself to many successful events and connections with students, staff, faculty and alumni, alike. He had a strong work ethic, a quick wit, an unforgettable sense of humor and was a master storyteller. Brad served as a mentor and role model to thousands of students, often spanning several generations.

In addition to his magnetic charm and the warmth he brought to the Graceland community, Brad was attracted to music at a young age and played guitar in many bands throughout his life; one could often hear the sound of faint guitar coming from his office in the Memorial Student Center between events or on a slow afternoon.

He loved to ride motorcycles, play golf and spend time outdoors. He took an interest in disc golf at Graceland and pioneered the construction of a course on campus, later facilitating disc golf tournaments in Lamoni and on campus.

Brad left this life suddenly Jan. 28, leaving a hole in the hearts of many. Memorial services were appropriately held in the MSC Main Room on the Graceland Lamoni, Iowa, campus Saturday, Feb. 3. A visitation the evening before brought friends from all over to celebrate a life and love held dear for decades. As longtime friend Greg Sutherland put it, “It sure was nice of Brad to throw us such a nice party; I just wish he was here with us to enjoy it.” To which Bob Kelly, another longtime friend, replied, “He is.”

His charisma lent itself to many successful events and connections with students, staff, faculty and alumni.

This is a celebration. Who wouldn’t be proud of the accomplishments of the Graceland graduates featured here? And what I find even more exciting is that this is only the beginning of what we predict for their future.
