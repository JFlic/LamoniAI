In November 2018, Graceland hired DAVID SIDDALL ’85 as the Vice President for Business and Finance.

He serves as chief financial officer and leader of business operations, bringing new skills and ways of thinking with extensive expertise in business, finance and law.

Siddall earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration with an emphasis in accounting from Graceland. He then continued his studies, completing a juris doctorate from the University of Iowa College of Law. After 25 years of corporate law practice, he returned to law school to earn his master’s of laws (LLM) in estate planning at the University of Miami.

Prior to joining Graceland, Siddall was vice president at two major energy companies and owner of a law firm, and he has a lifelong record of volunteer service. He brings an expansive knowledge of corporate governance, securities and finance, compliance and ethics, human resources, employee benefits, real estate, intellectual property, business operations, annual budgets exceeding $150 million, and management of relationships with diverse types of people, many with specialized knowledge.

Siddall’s commitment to Graceland’s mission combined with his experience, knowledge and ability to manage a variety of important university areas make him a strategic finance partner with the president, and he will provide innovative thought leadership to help Graceland get to the next level.

Siddall grew up in Lamoni with six siblings. His father served nearly 20 years as a member of Graceland’s staff, and Siddall himself held his first job as a teen and college student working for Graceland’s facility services.

Siddall’s primary office will be located on the Independence campus, and he will maintain a weekly presence on the Lamoni campus.
