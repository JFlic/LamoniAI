At Graceland’s Independence campus, Program Director Leigh Murray, PhD, her fellow faculty, and the entire support team of Graceland’sDoctor of Physical Therapy (DPT)program were overjoyed and immensely proud to lead the very first DPT cohort to theINAUGURAL PROFESSIONALISM CEREMONYin December 2024.

DPT student Sarah Taplin ’25 smiles proudly after receiving her white coat from clinical professors Jamie Dyson (left) and Darla Cathcart (right).

The heartfelt presentation of the white coats followed by an Oath of Professionalism symbolized the 22 graduates’ transition from classroom learning to real patient care — and their promise of commitment to professionalism, compassion, and ethical conduct.

“Professionalism is not a destination, but a continuous journey. This ceremony marks not only a recognition of the students’ dedication to their studies, but also a commitment to the values that define our program and the profession. Physical therapy is a calling to serve others with empathy, integrity, and expertise. As our students participate in this ceremony, they reflect on the tremendous responsibility, trust, and respect that society places in their hands as physical therapists.”

LEIGH MURRAY, PhDProgram Director, Clinical Professor

The2024 GRACELAND GOLF CLASSIC, held at the WinterStone Golf Course in Independence, MO, was more than just a round of golf – it was a celebration of connection and purpose. Each year, Graceland alumni gather for a friendly competition, and funds from the Golf Classic are thoughtfully allocated to projects that best support Graceland students.

Members of the Lysinger family teamed up for the annual Graceland Golf Classic.

This year, the four-player scramble brought together more than 25 teams and raised nearly $20,000 toward the Henson Strength and Conditioning Center project, a vital initiative to enhance the student experience. With opportunities to sponsor the event, individual holes, giveaways, and more, the Golf Classic offered something for everyone.

Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just looking to enjoy a fun day on the course, this annual tradition is the perfect way to reconnect with fellow Gracelanders while making a meaningful impact on current and future Yellowjackets.

Reception Leader, Yardage King, Touchdown Machine — Senior Gerald Monroe ’25 finished the season not only as an accomplished Yellowjacket wide receiver, but with regional and national recognition: asOFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEARin the NAIA Heart of America Athletic Conference (North), and with NAIA Coaches’FIRST-TEAM ALL-AMERICAhonors from the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA). In his record-setting 2024 campaign, the Glenn Heights, TX, native solidified his position as a premier player in NAIA football, leading the nation in every major receiving category with one of the greatest individual performances in program history.

Monroe’s efforts propelled the Yellowjackets to rank among the most productive offenses in the Heart of America Athletic Conference (North). His ability to dominate defensive matchups and deliver in key moments was pivotal to Graceland’s success. Monroe’s impact extends beyond impressive statistics. He has left an indelible mark on the Graceland football program, elevating its standard of excellence and inspiring his teammates for years to come.

“This is a great honor for Gerald and our football program. He has proven over the last three years to be one of the best players in the country — I’m glad his hard work and dedication paid off. In my 20-plus years of coaching, G is one of the best I’ve ever had, and that list includes several guys who have gone on to play in the NFL. Gerald’s football career is long from over, so it will be fun to watch it continue to blossom.”

The collaborative simulation created a variety of hands-on learning opportunities for HMS, SON, & DPT students — valuable training they can draw from in the field.

Propped up in hospital beds, Health and Movement Science (HMS) students from Lamoni put their lives into the hands of their fellow Graceland students in Nursing and Physical Therapy, convincingly — though not always with a straight face — playing their parts as patients. School of Nursing (SON), Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) and HMS faculty gathered everyone on the Independence campus for anINTERPROFESSIONAL EDUCATION EXPERIENCE (IPE)that put collaboration and communication between the disciplines at the center of a day filled with learning and application. At various stations and in hands-on simulations, the students teamed up for discussion, data collection, and demonstration — with the mutual goal of the best patient outcome.

Explaining the motivation behind organizing this first IPE:

“Collaboration is crucial in health care. A patient can’t succeed in remobilization and recovery if not all team members work together to combine their expertise and skill sets.”

JENNA SEGRAVES, DPTAssistant Clinical Professor

2024 School of Nursing graduate Sabriah Hasam

The IPE offered a unique on-site opportunity for the students to learn from each other in a safe environment of peers with immediate feedback from their professors. The positive feedback on the day attested all-round success: the interdisciplinary exercise provided ideal training grounds that all sides benefited from, preparing faculty for future events and students for professional settings or grad school.
