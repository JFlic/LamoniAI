## New  England  Women

Have  an  Abiding  Faith  in  Lydia  E. Pinkham's  Vegetable  Compound.

<!-- image -->

After t ears of  struggle  to attain and  m erit  public  confidence, w ith  a  firm fcnd  steadfast  belief  th a t  some  day  others  would  recognize  in  us  tho  tru th , good faith, and  honesty of  purpose which we know w e  possess, what  a genu­ ine  satisfaction  it  is  to  succced, and  to  realize tha  u p liftin g  influence  of  tho merited confidence of a vast army of our fellow beings.

Xhus  stands  tho  Pinkham  name  in  New England,  and  all  over  America, and nowhere is the faith in  Lydia E. Pinkham's V egetable Compound greater than in New England, its home. Merit, and m erit alone,  can gain this.

## k,  ORQANIC  INFLAMMATION.

' D ear  Mrs.  Pinkiiam : - I   w as troubled  very  badly  w ith  inflamma­ tion  of  tb e  bladder,  w as  sick  in   bed with it. I  h ad tw o  doctors, b u t  they did  mo  no  good. A friend  gave  me Lydia  E.  Pinkham's  Vegetable  Com­ pound, and it helped me. 1 have now taken  threo  bottles  of  it,  and  I  am entirely  cured. I t   is  a   God-send  to any woman, and I would recommend it to any one suffering as I was.  I think, if  m ost  of  the  women  would  take more  of  your  medicine  instead  of going  to  the  doctors,  they  would  bo better  oft. The  Compound  has  also cured my husband of kidney trouble.' Mrs.  Mabel  Gookin,

## Box 160. Mechanic Falls, Maine.

## NERVOUS  PROSTRATION.

' For  two  years  I  suffered  from nervous  prostration,  the  result  of female weakness. I  h ad  leueorrhoea ▼ery badly, and at  tim e of  m enstrua­ tion  would  be  obliged  to  go  to  bed. Also  suffered  w ith  headaches,  pain .  across  back,  and  in  lower  p art  of abdomen. I   w as  so  discouraged. I had read of  Lydia E.  Pinkham's Comr sund. and concluded to give it a trial. wrote to Mrs. Pinkham, and received a very nice letter  in  return. I  b egan at once the use of her Vegetable Com­ pound and Blood Purifier, and am now feeling splendid. I have no more pain at  m onthly  periods,  can  do  my  own work, and have gained ten pounds. I would not be without your Vegetable Compound. I t  is a splendid medicine. I  am very thankful for w hat ithas dono for  me.' - Mrs.  J.  }V.  J., 7G Carolina Ave., Jam aica Plain",  Mass.

## PAINFUL  PERIODS.

111  cannot  help  but  feel  th a t  it  is my duty to do something in regard to recommending  your wonderful  medi-

cine. I must say it is  the  g r a n d e s t medicine on  earth, and  have  advised a  great  many  suf­ fering w ith female troubles to  take it. ,1 tell people I w ish I   could  go  on  th e | platform  and  leoture on it.

' My trouble v u painful  menstruaation. Tha  Buffering  I  endured  pen cannot  describe. I   was  treated  by one of our m ost prominent physicianB here for five m onths, and found myself getting  w orse  instead  of  better. At the end of  th e  fifth month he told  me he had  done  all  he  could  for me,  and th a t I h ad   b e tte r  go to the hospital.

' My sister  advised  me  to try your Vegetable Compound, as it  cured  her of  backache. I  did  so,  and  took  it faithfully,  and  am  now cured  of  my trouble,  and  in   perfect  health, many thanks  to  your  medicine. I cannot praise  it  enough, and  would  recom­ mend  it  to  all  who  suffer  from  any female w eakness.'- Mrs. II. S. Baix, 4G1  Orchard  St.,  New Haven, Conn.

## MOTHER  AND  DAUGHTER.

## of Mr. The  Wife  aiul Mothor-ln-Lair Charles  Keys.

CLARISSA,  Minn.,  April  15,  (Spe­ cial.)-No  family  in  this  vicinity is better  known  or  more  universally  re­ spected,  than  Mr.  Charles  Keys,  the. local  School  Teacher,  and  his  estim a­ ble  wife,  and  mother-in-law. For  a long  timo,  Mrs.  Keys  has  been  in  111 health. Recently,  however,  she  has found a curc for her ailments  in Dodd's Kidney  Pills.

"I cannot sp%ik too  highly of Dodd's  Kidney  Pills,  or  of  w hat  they have  done  for  me,'  said  Mrs.  Keys.

'My  life  was  miserablo,  my back always  ached,  also  my  head. I was troubled  with  Neuralgia  in  tho  head and  face  and  suffered  extreme pain, but  thanks  to  Dodd's  Kidney  Pills,  all those  aches  and  pains  have  vanished like  the  morning  dew,  and i t now seems  that lifo  is  w orth  living. I  con­ sider  Dodd's  Kidney  Pills  a   God-send to  suffering  hum anity. They may rightly  be  named  the  Elixir  of  Youth.

''While  speaking  of.  my  own  case and  tho  wonderful  benefit  I  have  re­ ceived,  I  might  also  add,  th a t my mother,  who  is  now  an  <?ld  lady  of 74  years  and  who  lives  w ith  me,  has been  troubled  more  or  less,  w ith  aches and  pains,  as  is  natural  w ith  one  of her  advanced  age. When  she saw what  Dodd's  Kidney Pills  had  done  for me.  she  commenced  to  use  them  her­ self,  and  she  says  th a t  they  have  done her  more  good  than  any  other  medi­ cine  she  has  ever  tried.

"This  testimony  is  given in the hope  that  others  who  may be af­ flicted  as  we  were,  may  see  and  read it,  and  be  benefited  by  it.''

CrSiniy. What  Mrs.  Keys  states  in  her can  be  verified  by  reference  t her  many  friends  in  t' hood. Dodd's  Ki'' ll!;j   p. y  £hy  of >9 neighbor.tis have  al­ ready  a  w^u(jgrfUj  «^pUtat}on  jn  Todd

## CAPTIVATING SHIRTWAISTS.

## There  Are  Many  Charming  and  Accept­ able  Spring;  SlyW

There is no genuin/ shirtwaist weather  yet,  but  w om ankind  is  evi­ dently  determined  to  be  equipped  for the  pleasant season  w hen  it  does  come. Petticoated purchasers now stand 'n re e   deep  about  th e   counters  where the  new  cotton  blouses  are  displayed. Shirt  manufacturers  have  learned  to cater  to  every  taste  by  producing  no less  th a n   a  dozen  v a rie tie s  of  th is  in ­ valuable  garment,  ranging  from  the perfectly  plain  percale  and  duck to organdie  and  fancifully  trimmed  silk madras  garments.  T here  is  no  tenden­ cy  to  reinaugurate  th e  use  of the stiff  white linen  collah Contrasting and  fanciful  neckties  hang  cheek by jowl  with  the  shirts,  and  no  woman can  escape the  hint.  Sleeves,  as  is  only natural,  are  inclined  to   tho bishop shape,  to  w rist  puffs  o r  double  cuff  ef­ fects,  and  bosoms  still  pouch  a  little and  hang  in  soft  fullness. Last au­ tumn,  when  the new  flannel waists were  put  on  the  counters,  the  women who  rushed  in  to  buy  turned  away  in disgust,  for the manufacturers had daringly  tried  to  force  a  tight  fitting shirt. The  sacrificial  sales ot tig h t flannel  shirtw aists  now   forced  a t  tho retail  shops  have impressed  the  m er­ chants  with  a  sense  of  th e ir  own  help­ lessness  in  choosing  th e  mode, and among  the  percale  an d   toil  du  nord, and  brown  batiste^and  colored  French linen  shirts  not  one  basque-like  model is  seen.

Pretty  sailor blouses  are  evidently going  to  play a  p a r t this  spring,  for dozens  of  charm ing  w h ite  and  colored cotton  examples  are  being  brought  up decorated  with  collar,  cuffs,  a tiny steel  blue  linen  blouse  of  this  variety, opening  over  a  vest  of  finely  tucked white  linen  and  decorated  with  big white  cut  pearl  buttons. A  rival to this  is  a  sh irt ot  so ft  toil du nord, decorated  with  collar,  cuffs, a tiny yoke  and  broad  fro n t  band  of  exceed­ ingly  coarse cream  linen  lace edged with  a  narrow  cream   linen  braid,  and a  third  noticeably  popular  model  is made  of  gingham  in  blue,  brown,  red or  green  embroidered  in  dots  of  a   con­ trasting  color  and  m ade  up  w ith  em­ broidered  bands  th a t  echo the two colors  in  the  m aterial  itself.-Boston Globe.

## GUESSING  AT  THE  "ADS.'

## lorra  of  Puzzle Worklujr  Devised  by  » New  York  Young?  Woman.

A  new  game  is  being  played  on  tho upper  west  side  by  young  people,  say3 the New  York Sun. I t   is  an  outgrow th of  the  immense  am ount  of  pictorial advertising  which  is  being  done  in  all the  newspapers,  m agazines  and  street cars  and  elevated  trains. Alinust  ull articles  which have  a  sale th a t is more  than  purely  local,  whether  they be  books,  corsets,  gloves,  magazines, crackers, pickles,  h a ir tonics,  stovo polishes,  or  linim ents,  have  nowadays some pictures which have become identified  with them   in the public mind  through  seeing  them  in  all  sorts of  public  places. This  led  a  certain young  woman,  who  was  at  a  loss  for something  new  to  do  for  an  evening's entertainm ent  to  w ork out  a game. She  collccted  a  lo t  of  magazines and cut  from  the  back  pages  all  tho  ad­ vertising  pictures,  carefully  removing any  hint ot  the article advertised, which  was not  a  p a rt  of the  piitm v itself. Then  she  selected  thirty-six  of them  and  pasted  them   on  cards,  giv­ ing  to each  a number. These she strung  around  her  parlors  and  when her  guests  arrived  they  were  put at work  to  find  out  w h a t  the  pictures  ad­ vertised. Some of  tho  pictures  were  so familiar  that  the  ta sk   was  not  difficult and  yet  it  was  sui prising  to  find  how confusing  it all  w as to the puzzle workers. Pictures  th a t  seemed  fami liar  were mighty elusive  when it came to identiffying them among thirty-six  others. The  soap  ads  got dreadfully  mixed  up,  and  so  did  the hair  restorers. I f th e pictures  were ever  published  labeled  the  way  most of  the guests guessed  there  would have  followed a  w hole  lot of  trade mark  infringem ent  suits. The girls were  very  much  better  at  the  work than  the  young  m en,  presumably  be­ cause the  articles advertised were mostly  household  things and  so of more  interest  to  th e  fair  sex  than  to their  brothers. Of  the  thirty-six  pic­ tures  the  highest  num ber  guessed  was twenty-five  and  th is  was  by  one  of  the young  women.
