Graceland does reserve the right to deny admission to a student who is deemed unable to adjust successfully to the Graceland environment.

A student seeking admission to Graceland from high school must submit an application (www.graceland.edu/apply), a high school transcript with at least six semesters of work. Optional documents include ACT or SAT results. Documents should be sent to the Admissions Office, Graceland University, 1 University Place, Lamoni, Iowa 50140.

Of the credentials Graceland University evaluates, a student’s overall academic record is far the most important.

ACT & SAT Test Scores

Effective immediately, Graceland will begin superscoring SAT and ACT scores. Superscoring means a college considers the highest section scores across all testing dates. For example, if you take the ACT twice, we will consider your highest Math, English, Reading, and Science section scores even if those didn’t come from the same testing date.

ACT prep for college bound studentsSAT prep guide

General Educational Development (GED) and other state or nationally recognized test scores may be used as high school equivalency.

Acceptance of a student will be on a conditional basis until Graceland receives the final official high school transcript. Transcripts must be mailed directly from the school and have the official school seal affixed, or transmitted electronically through any certified vendor.

For athletic eligibility, the ACT/SAT test results must come from official test centers on the national testing dates. To ensure Graceland University receives your results in a timely manner be sure to enter our school code (ACT = 1314 / SAT = 6249).

A Placement Test will be required to determine proper placement in English and Math if ACT or SAT scores are not submitted.

Graceland welcomes applications from homeschooled students. We acknowledge the important contributions that homeschoolers make, both in the classroom and as part of student life. Graceland makes a deliberate effort to accommodate the special circumstances of homeschooled students during the admissions process.

Submit the following items

Transfer students, including community and junior college transfers, who have earned 56 transferable semester hours with a grade point average of 2.00 based on a 4.00 point system, if accepted, will enter Graceland at junior standing.

Courses accepted for transfer will be accepted as credit only and will not carry grade points. Credit will be accepted for courses in which the student earned a grade of D- or better.

Credit or waiver through College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and Advanced Placement (AP) will be determined by Graceland upon receipt of the scores from the College Board and will not necessarily correspond with what the previous school may have awarded.

A detailed statement on transfer policies is available in the Registrar’s Office or you may clickhere.

Graceland University has developed standards for acceptance based on commonly used indicators, which reflect a prospective student has been prepared and has the potential to complete college level work at a passing level. These indicators are chosen as they reflect a student’s aptitude for certain subjects, commitment to their education, and performance.

The alternate procedure for acceptance is designed to provide a pathway for admission for students who do not meet these standards. This process gathers additional information which may be helpful in determining the readiness of a prospective student, which may not be adequately reflected by the acceptance criteria.

Advisors are to consult with the Executive Director of Admissions when they become aware of a student, for which the alternate procedure may be appropriate for consideration. Additional pieces of information will be requested by the Executive Director of Admissions, or designee, on a case-by-case basis, and usually includes the following:

The Admissions Advisor, Coach, or Executive Director of Admissions, will communicate directly with the prospective student, outlining what is requested and a deadline for completion. Once collected, information regarding prospective student athletes will be evaluated by the Athletic Director, or designee, and forwarded to the Executive Director of Admissions, for review and acceptance decision. All other prospective students will be forwarded directly to the Executive Director of Admissions, or their designee.

When a decision has been reached, it will be communicated to the Admissions Advisor/Coach and Enrollment Operations to have the prospective student’s record updated to reflect the acceptance decision.

The Admissions Advisor, Coach, the Executive Director of Admissions, or their designee will contact the student to let them know the decision within one week of submission of all requested materials.

Graceland’s articulation agreements facilitate credit transfer. To view equivalency listings go to theTransfer Evaluation System (TES)or for a detailed listing of the following articulation agreements contact the Registrar’s Office:
