This fall, David DeBarthe ’58 is taking “History of Inequality in the United States,” one of the classes being taught by Instructor of History Eric Elliott ’14. Elliott is the grandson of former history, sociology, and religion professor Alma Blair ’49, who became a mainstay for Graceland courses in History of Latter Day Saintism, Western Civilization, World Civilization, and Greek and Roman History during his tenure (1955-1994). DeBarthe took at least one class from Blair back in the early 1960s.

DeBarthe is probably the only Gracelander to ever take classes from both a grandparent and grandchild. In fact, Elliott and Blair are likely the only grandchild/grandparent faculty to date. They’re the only ones we know of, anyway.
