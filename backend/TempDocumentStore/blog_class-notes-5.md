Mel Kauila Clark ’68passed away on Dec. 24, 2017. His life was committed to sharing with others the principle elements of Native Hawaiian values, Aloha and physical well-being.

Kauila grew up in Wahiawa and graduated from Leilehua High School in 1963. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in drawing and painting from Graceland College in 1968 and later earned his master’s degree in clay and sculpture at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington.

A certified traditional native Hawaiian health practitioner, Kauila was an artist, a master potter, educator and lecturer. His artwork, internationally acclaimed, has been exhibited in 53 countries and museums such as the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

Professor Clark taught design, drawing, painting, ceramics, art history and art appreciation at Graceland from 1971-83. Several of his pieces are included in Graceland’s fine art collection, and a large collaborative work adorns the Shaw Center lobby. Kauila’s legendary influence on students of all disciplines continues.

Marcia L. Kemp ’59 Lloydreceived the Lifetime Achievement Award at the National Dance Education Organization’s (NDEO) national conference in San Antonio, Texas, Nov. 12, 2017.

Marcia married Arthur Lloyd, from Independence, Missouri, in 1960. They continued their journey together teaching in higher education institutions — counselor education for Arthur and dance education for Marcia. Over the years, they have resided in Laramie, Wyoming; Bozeman, Montana; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Pocatello, Idaho.

Both retired from Idaho State University, and they now travel most of the year to Seattle (visiting their two grandsons), Malaysia, London and Honolulu.

Kenneth Cochran, Graceland University Hall of Fame inductee (1989), passed away Nov. 19, 2017, at the age of 84 — one month shy of his 85th birthday. Cochran ’52 receivedan Associate of Arts degree from Graceland with physical education as his major. He was a Gimper and played on the men’s basketball team and the club baseball team.

In 1956, Cochran served as the starting catcher on the Olympic Baseball Team. Cochran’s coaching career spanned a quarter of a century, and when he left coaching at the age of 48 after suffering a heart attack, he remained involved with basketball. He invented the widely popular Pop-A-Shot game and was longtime director of the Heart of America Basketball Camps and Clinics in Salina, Kansas.

Cochran was inducted into six halls of fame — NAIA, Kansas Sports, Kansas Basketball Coaches Association, Kansas Wesleyan, Graceland University and Joplin, Missouri. He established the Graceland University Ken Cochran Endowed Scholarship to assist tennis and men’s and women’s basketball players.

Ken Cooper ’51received an Associate of Arts degree from Graceland with music education as his major. He received his Bachelor of Music Education degree from Kansas State College in Pittsburg, Kansas, in 1953 and continued to receive his master’s in music composition in 1965.

Cooper returned to Graceland to teach music of every sort from 1971-83. He taught music theory, woodwinds, brass, percussion, instrumental and choral arranging, conducting and piano. He was the composer for the Adventureland and Boblo Island amusement park shows featuring Graceland students and founded The Music Company tour programs. Graceland’s music department still uses Cooper’s musical arrangement for the alma mater.

In addition to writing and arranging music, Cooper spent many years as a church organist and choir director. His performance activities included classical music and playing in many jazz groups. He has more than 150 published compositions for instrumental and choral ensembles. Cooper’s commissioned composition, “A Star,” had its premiere performance in December 2000 by the Kansas City Symphony.

Cooper died June 18, 2017, at age 85 in Papillion, Nebraska, after struggling 12 years with Parkinson’s disease. His ashes were placed in Graceland Park Cemetery in Omaha, Nebraska. A tree was planted in his honor by the Arbor Society in the Chippewa National Forest (Minnesota), and a bench was dedicated at Graceland University.

Kenneth ’47andJoyce Beitz ’49 Swails, O’Fallon, Missouri, were both honored by their children with a 90th birthday surprise card shower. Over 100 cards were sent from family and friends from all over the country.

Zimmerman Brothers Remember Their Time at Graceland

Keith Zimmerman ’44 fondly recalls his time at Graceland and that he was able to attend his freshman year because he gave the registrar $100 from working all summer on the farm. He took accounting and business classes and went on to work in the lumber and hardware business. Neal ’47 was at Graceland with his brothers, and whenHorizonsasked him, “What did you study?” Neal’s response was, “mostly girls!” Current students might be honest and say, “Guess some things haven’t changed in 70 years!”

The youngest brother, Dale ‘47, will turn 90 in May, and he was at Graceland in the accounting classes with Keith. When the professor would ask Mr. Zimmerman for an answer, they flipped a coin to see who would answer.

Charles (Bob) Laudie ’40passed away Dec. 24, 2017, in Iowa City, Iowa. Laudie graduated from William Chrisman High School in Independence, Missouri, and was offered a job in facilities at Graceland. He “worked hard shoveling coal and snow, earning two cents an hour toward the next year’s expenses.” With the year’s earnings on the books, he became a student the next fall and two years later received an Associate of Arts degree from Graceland. He wrote his memoirs about his time at Graceland and shared them as a view into student life on “the Hill.”

He was employed by Lockheed before entering the Army AirCorp Aviation school in January 1942. During WWII, Bob was a B26 navigator/bombardier flying out of England. He flew over 73 missions including two over Utah Beach on D-day. Laudie received his BA from San Jose State University and MA from Stanford with postgraduate work at University of California, Berkeley. Laudie was principal of large California elementary schools for over 33 years.

His interests included HAM radio, and he helped build the Community of Christ church building in Walnut Creek. He also worked on the Happy Valley church campground and rejuvenated the Cloverdale Historical Society.
