John Godfrey, MA, ’06

It is a privilege to serve as your Alumni Board President and connect with you through this letter. As I reflect on my time at Graceland, I am filled with gratitude for the profound impact it has had on my personal and professional journey. Serving as Agape House President and as GSG President were pivotal experiences that shaped my path to fulfilling my 18-year career in higher education. Today, in my role as Alumni Board President, I am honored to give back to the institution that has given me so much.

Graceland continues to stand out in the ever-changing landscape of higher education. Innovative programs, such as the transformational leadership major, are equipping students with vital skills in communication, teamwork, and adaptability — qualities I developed during my time at Graceland and that are now being intentionally nurtured in today’s students.

As alumni, we have a vital role in supporting Graceland’s mission. Programs like the alumni-endowed scholarship and GU4U, which provide students with career readiness resources, are just a few of the ways we can make a meaningful impact. I encourage you to stay connected and involved. Whether it’s mentoring a student, sharing Graceland with prospective students, or strengthening regional alumni networks, your contributions are invaluable. If you’d like to get involved, please reach out to us atalumni@graceland.edu— we’d love to connect you with opportunities to support our Graceland community.

While higher education continues to evolve, Graceland’s unique and supportive community remains its cornerstone. Together, we can ensure future generations of students have the chance to create their own transformative Graceland experiences. Thank you for your unwavering passion and dedication to this remarkable institution.

John Godfrey, MA, ’06President, Graceland Alumni Board of Directors
