# COVID-19 | Graceland

Source URL: https://www.graceland.edu/covid-19/#top

Updated August 11, 2022

Graceland University puts the health and safety of its community as its highest priority. We continue to monitor the ongoing coronavirus variants and are encouraged as we see the development of new treatments, improvements to vaccines that are effectively preventing major illness, and weakening symptoms. With these factors in mind, masks will no longer be mandated anywhere on the Lamoni campus, including classrooms.

What This Means

A Note About Monkeypox

The administration is continuously monitoring the outbreak of monkeypox across the United States. Currently, we suggest that faculty and staff simplyeducate themselves on the virus. We are working closely with the Decatur County Health Department and will provide more information as necessary.

Graceland staff applied for and receivedHigher Education Emergency Relief Fundsfrom the Department of Education.

Graceland signed and returned the U.S. Department of Education Certification and Agreement in 2020 and confirms that Graceland will use no less than 50% of the funds received under section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act to provide emergency financial aid grants to students.

To be considered for funding, students needed to apply. An online application form was posted on the internal website and advertised via emails to eligible students. Students were asked to identify the COVID related impact and identify if Graceland was authorized to apply any amount of grant dollars directly to their student account. Grants were made available via direct deposit or check.

Graceland staff continue to develop processes by which the remaining funds will be awarded. These numbers have been updated on July 8, 2020; Aug. 22, 2020; Oct. 29, 2020; Jan. 27, 2021; April 9, 2021; July 10, 2021; October 7, 2021; April 15, 2022; July 10, 2022.

Graceland University has strived to ensure that the academic experience on our campuses maintains its high quality for our students. We also have placed a priority on the community aspect of what makes Graceland special and unique, so we have been thrilled to meet in person for the vast majority of the pandemic. Local, state, and federal recommendations have guided us throughout the process and our students have been engaged in-person in all academic, athletic, and student life experiences, resulting in a more positive experience for all.

As we look to the future, we will continue to be guided by those local, state, and federal guidelines and ask that all students, faculty, staff, and visitors continue to do the same. The health and safety of our community is our highest priority and I thank you for all you have done during the past two years. We will continue to update our community on the latest guidelines as needed. Until then, please be mindful of guidance from the CDC and the state public health authorities.
