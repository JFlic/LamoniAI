Sharing some exciting news from “the Hill”

September 19, 2023

I am thrilled to share some exciting news with you about your home on “the Hill.”

Today, I announced a significant transformation to the way Graceland approaches tuition and financial aid. Beginning in the 2024-25 academic year, Graceland’s published tuition price will change from $32,500 to $19,950, a price that is closer to what students actually pay.

For over 125 years, we have been committed to providing high-quality education and experiences for our students. And for many years, the cost of college was increasingly complex to navigate. Sallie Mae recently published a study that said that more than 75% of families eliminate schools from consideration based on published tuition price alone – they don’t even look at the generous financial aid schools like Graceland offer to students.

The bottom line is thatGraceland has always been an affordable option for families. Thanks in part to our generous alumni, we have been able to offer generous financial aid and scholarships, and we will continue to do so under this new model. However, we wanted our tuition price to reflect what students are actually paying for a Graceland education.

Why are we making this change, especially during a moment when we’re seeingrecord enrollment?

Now, we get to engage with students and their families and share how they make their hope of a Graceland education a reality.

Current students can be assured that they will not pay more in tuition this year vs. last year, and moving forward, all students can expect a simplified financial aid process that offers a clearer picture of the cost of attending Graceland.

The value of a Graceland education is just as high as it has ever been, and I believe that it has never been more important to receive a four-year degree for a successful future. With the launch of ourTransformational Leadership major, Graceland students now receive two majors for the price of one. We are the only institution in the US with this innovative model—but alumni like you know that this is what Graceland does best. We will continue adding new courses,new programs, and enhancements to the Graceland experience to attract more students to study in Lamoni. What we are removing is the sticker shock that some families might have felt when they first looked at Graceland.

For many years, we have been saying thatthe world needs more Graceland graduates. Transforming our tuition is the latest step we have taken in ensuring that all have access to the special and valuable experience our students have on campus. In the next few months, I will be visiting with alumni groups in several cities and holding some virtual conversations about how you can partner with us to continue to innovate and grow Graceland for the next generation of students. I look forward to seeing some of you atHomecomingon September 29-October 1, and if you have any questions or feedback, I would love to hear from you at president@graceland.edu.
