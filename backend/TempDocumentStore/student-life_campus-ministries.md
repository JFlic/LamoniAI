As a part of the Student Life team, Campus Ministries seeks to help students find aspiritual homewhile at Graceland University.

Aspiritual homeis a courageous space where each individual can explore and deepen their relationship with the divine. A disciple of Jesus Christ can practice and experience Christ’s mission of compassion, evangelism, justice, peacemaking and discipleship. Campus Ministries is a partnership withCommunity of Christ, the founding and sponsoring church of Graceland University.

The Enduring Principles of Community of Christare at the core of who we are and what we do:

Campus Ministries seeks to build community, share faith and create peace.It is much more than just our slogan. Together with students, faculty and staff, we are called to build community in our houses, through our ministries and across campus; to share faith through worship, education, action and interfaith experiences; to work for justice in such a way that we create peace for the world, our campus, one another and ourselves; to equip ourselves and others for service; and to experience and engage first-hand in mission.

Campus Ministries offers many ways to get involved. While we continue to seek new ways of doing things, our current ministries and activities include:

The elected house chaplains and the Chaplain President are called to build community, share faith, and create justice and peace in their respective houses and campus-wide through initiatives and activities. The chaplains serves in an advisory role to the campus minister. Chaplains are an important part of the House Council of each house. Students who serve as chaplains for athletic teams or student clubs and organization are welcome to join the organization. Students who serve in this in this way may be able to earn academic credit for their service and leadership.

This group of student employees is responsible for a wide-range of services and ministries across campus. It includes student pastors, worship coordinators, SafeRide/SafeWalk coordinator and assistants and others. Positions change year-to-year based on student interests, needs and giftedness. Students who serve in this way may also be able to earn academic credit for their service and leadership.
