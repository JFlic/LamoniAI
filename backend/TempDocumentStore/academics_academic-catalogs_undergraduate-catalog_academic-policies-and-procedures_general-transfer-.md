- For undergraduate programs, the Registrar has the responsibility for the evaluation and awarding of transfer credits according to university transfer policies.
- For graduate programs, the appropriate school has the responsibility for the evaluation and awarding of transfer credits. Only a maximum of 25% of any graduate or professional degree program may be approved for transfer credit.
- Credits must have been earned from regionally accredited institutions, as determined by the Transfer Credit Practices of Designated Educational Institutions, published by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. Credit not ordinarily accepted as shown in this guide may be accepted at Graceland if it is verified that course work from the sending institution is recognized and accepted at any major state university within that state, or if the credits have been approved for acceptance by Graceland’s schools/divisions.
- Students must have earned a grade of D- or better for transfer courses to be accepted for credit at Graceland University. Note: Transfer grades do not carry grade points. Courses accepted for transfer are accepted as credit only and are recorded with a transfer grade of “TA, TB, TC, TD, or TP” in place of a letter grade.
- An unlimited number of collegiate-level sh. may be transferred to Graceland University. However, only a limited number of developmental, remedial, physical education activity, vocational-technical, music ensemble and English as a Second Language sh. are acceptable. Please see the following table for the maximum number of sh. accepted in each area:Course TypeSemester HoursNotesVocational-technical16Accepted as elective creditPhysical education activity8Limited to 4 sh of intercollegiate sportEnglish as a Second Language8Developmental or remedial coursework6Music ensemble8

- Credit for proficiency examinations taken at previous post-secondary institutions is not awarded.
- Credit for military programs and training is awarded according to ACE recommendations in the baccalaureate category in the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services.
- Graduates of colleges and/or schools of nursing located outside the US may find it impossible to obtain official transcripts from the institution. After all other efforts to obtain an official transcript have failed, the student may request a letter from any college attended in the US or from the state board of nursing. A copy of the “foreign transcript” received by the college or state board should accompany the letter with a statement certifying it is a true copy of the official transcript received previously by the college or state board from the foreign institution.
- Credit may be awarded for post-secondary education completed at colleges and/or universities in foreign countries. A course-by-course evaluation provided by the World Education Service (WES) ,International Credential Evaluations (InCred), Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE), or Scholaro, Inc. is required before awarding credit. If the student is pursuing admission to the MSN program, nursing credits earned at an institution outside the US are evaluated by the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) before awarding credits.
- All work transferred from two-year institutions will be considered lower division. However, some two-year college courses may meet the intent of specific upper division courses at Graceland. In this case, the courses are assigned a lower division number “0000” and the upper division course is included on the academic record as “WV”. The intent of the course is met, but the hours will not count toward the upper division requirement.
- Any questions and concerns should be directed to the Registrar’s Office.
- Credit for proficiency examinations taken at previous post-secondary institutions is not awarded.
- Credit does not become obsolete, but application of some credit to a specific program at Graceland may be subject to review by department faculty.
- Graceland’s course number, as listed in the current catalog, is assigned to equivalent transfer courses.
- An elective course number, “0000” for lower division courses or “4999” for upper division courses, is assigned to non-equivalent transfer courses.
- Course titles and semester hours assigned by the sending institution are generally retained on the Graceland record.
- Quarter hours are converted to semester hours; one quarter hour equals 2/3 of a semester hour.
- Department faculty and college catalogs may be consulted for advice. Undergraduate students may petition the university, appropriate school or college to request variance in program requirements in light of previous background.
