LAMONI, IOWA (November 7, 2012)—The Graceland University Music Department hosted the 2012 Pride of Iowa Conference Honor Choir on Tuesday, November 6. The Guest Conductor was Lisa Evans, Director of Parkview and Prairie Middle Schools in Ankeny, Iowa. The day culminated with a well-attended concert, which also featured the Graceland Choir.

More than 80 students from 12 public schools in the Pride of Iowa Conference gathered for a day of workshops and rehearsals on Graceland’s Lamoni, IA campus. High schools from Bedford, Central Decatur (Leon), Corning, East Union (Afton), Interstate 35 (Truro), Lenox, Mt. Ayr, Nodaway Valley, Pleasantville, Wayne (Corydon), Martensdale-St. Mary’s and Southeast Warren (Liberty Center) school districts were represented.

The day featured workshops and rehearsals in Graceland’s just-dedicated performing arts venue, the Shaw Center. The $16 million expanded Shaw Center now includes the acoustically-perfect recital facility, Carol Hall, where the high school students had a chance to experience a world-class performance venue. The students enjoyed the day’s activities and had many opportunities to meet with Graceland’s excellent music faculty members, including Maestro Jack Ergo, Director of Orchestras and Frank Perez, Director of Bands. Several GU adjunct instructors and Graceland choral students were also busy working with the students throughout the day.

Ergo said, “This was a tremendous opportunity for the best of the best high school choir members from around our region to learn and perform together as a group. We are glad they had a chance to experience our amazing new Shaw Center. Graceland University was honored to host this event.”

Pride of Iowa Honor Choir members are carefully selected as some of the top student musicians in their program by their high school musical directors. Lisa Evans did an excellent job working with the students and she served as guest conductor and clinician.
