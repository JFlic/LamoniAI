The Enactus leadership team had the opportunity to visit The Coral Nursery site and learn about coral restoration while in Puerto Rico for the 2022 Enactus World Cup held Oct. 30 – Nov. 2.

ALUMNA MARISSA MYER ’18 HOSTED THE ENACTUS TEAMand shared her vision for The Coral Nursery project located in Palmas del Mar. The Coral Nursery will be the first self-sustaining satellite coral restoration unit (CRU) to date. Using micro-fragmentation, their CRU will be able to reproduce 100,000 corals annually! This healing process is 25-40% faster than the rate corals can grow on their own in the wild, and will enable The Coral Nursery to restore a 100-year-old coral in just two years!
