Graceland Forward’s accelerated certificate programs lay the groundwork for continuous improvement, innovation, and growth for today’s business professionals.

July 28, 2023

Successful business professionals know the power of lifelong learning. And this summer, Graceland University introducesGraceland Forward, a professional development and personal enrichment platform for learners seeking certificates as they continue building career skills.

Produced in partnership withSkillPath, a leader in learning and development, Graceland Forward’s initial offerings include live, interactive certificate programs delivered online over one week, providing a faster pathway for learners to acquire essential business skills.

“Graceland’s acquisition of SkillPath over 25 years ago signaled to our students, our alumni, and the greater educational community our true commitment to lifelong learning,” said Graceland President Patricia H. Draves, PhD. “Graceland Forward is the evolution of that commitment and will educate transformational leaders in businesses and organizations across the world through these programs.”

Certificates are available in a variety of topic areas, including:

All certificate programs are delivered live, online in interactive sessions over three to five days. The 3-hour, half-day format allows busy professionals to put what they’ve learned into practice immediately at work. Upon program completion, learners will receive a certificate and digital eBadge from Graceland University.

“Professional continuing education is in demand,” saidJeff McElroy, Chair of Graceland University’sC.H. Sandage School of Businessand a faculty advisor for Graceland Forward. “With Graceland Forward, today’s busy professionals can unlock their growth potential. These accelerated certificate programs are affordable, accessible, and provide the skills individuals need to make career transitions, get promoted, make personal improvements, and stay marketable.

“The accelerated certificate programs, developed in partnership with Graceland University’s faculty and our in-house instructional design team, are some of SkillPath’s newest and most successful programs,” said Michele Markey, CEO of SkillPath. “They’re a perfect fit for today’s busy, on-the-move professionals.”

In the coming months, Graceland Forward will expand its live training options, as well as add on-demand courses to its offerings. Additional certificates are in development.
