Graceland AthleticswelcomesreturningMattSheltonas Director of Sports Communication.

September 5, 2024 | jns

Walking across campus with a joyful stride, that’s when it kicks in just how much he had missed the sites and the people that make up Graceland University.Matt Shelton ’01, MS, is returning home to the place and the role: as Director of Sports Communication.

From 2007-2016, Shelton had served the Yellowjackets as Sports Information Director as well as Associate Athletic Director. The position has evolved and progressed since—and so has he.

Growing up around and on the sports grounds of Lamoni and Graceland in a prominent family of enthusiasts for just about any game had a lasting impression on Shelton. He further pursued the field: from a master’s degree in Sport Management with an Athletic Administration concentration, over Athletic Director appointments, to teaching and coaching the next generations within the public school system.

For a while, he ventured into a completely different direction, doing sales and business consultancy in finance and pharma. But his heart just wasn’t in it, so when Graceland University Athletic Director Brady McKillip extended the offer to return to his old domain and bring in his comprehensive athletics experience and passion, he did not hesitate.

“I’m honored to return to my alma mater as Director of Sports Communication,” says Shelton. “Graceland is such a uniquely special place to me and my family.Being away for the last eight years, the feeling of belonging to the Graceland community never left me, and the pull to return was always there.”

“I’m grateful to Brady McKillip for his confidence in me, and I look forward to working with the entire Graceland Athletics department to help tell the stories of our talented student-athletes and this amazing institution.”
