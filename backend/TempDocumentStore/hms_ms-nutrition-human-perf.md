This course is designed to introduce students to the background, basic principles, and methods of health epidemiology, with an emphasis on critical thinking, analytic skills, and application to clinical practice. Topics covered in this course include basic principles of epidemiology; measures of disease frequency; epidemiologic study designs: experimental and observational; bias; confounding; outbreak investigations; screening; causality; and ethical issues in epidemiologic research. In addition, students will develop skills to read, interpret and evaluate health information from published epidemiologic studies. Offered Summer semester.

This course is designed to introduce students to health promotion and the development of a health promotion plan that could be incorporated at an individual, group, or community level. This will be accomplished through implementing basic community health concepts of epidemiology, levels of prevention, and risk assessment within the context of health promotion activities. Topics to be covered include community organization, coalition building, curriculum development, communication theory and technology, social marketing, mass media, and ecological models. Offered Summer semester.
