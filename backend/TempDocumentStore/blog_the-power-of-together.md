Last Monday night, Graceland exemplified a university working together at its best, and the result was a Heart of America Men’s Basketball Conference Tournament Championship Title. The night was electric with standing room only in our athletic facility and a feeling I could never capture with words. Pure joy, hope and unleashed pride would be my attempts, but these would fall short.

The hundreds of student fans were pumped and cheering on their classmates for the entire game. The campus and local community followed their lead. It was an evening of pride in who we are, what we stand for, and to celebrate a significant accomplishment – together.

Coach Doty’s positivity, commitment to excellence and knowledge that each minute counts – whether during the conference championship game, practice or in a classroom – has clearly been instilled in his players, and it was great for others to see that in action. But that is only half the story; it was the Graceland community that made that electric environment!

Our full choir sang the national anthem, and our students decorated the facility with the help of faculty and staff. We showcased the most blue and gold in the venue I have ever seen, and we had a “white out” to support our home team wearing white. Students, faculty, facility services, student life, admissions and cheerleading were just a few areas to contribute, and the entire coaching staff of all sports was out in full force!

The Power of Together lives out each day here at Graceland, and this was a great way to celebrate its greatness with a trophy! On to Nationals at the Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City Thursday, March 15, at 5:45 p.m. I hope to see you there!
