Isaac Pressnell, Graceland University Assistant Professor of English

Like a Flock of Tiny Birds, a poem by Graceland University Assistant Professor of English Isaac Pressnell, has been selected to appear in the annual anthology The Best American Experimental Writing 2015. The poem was co-authored with poet Maggie Glover, and is “part of a larger, intersubjective, partially aleatory project,” according to Pressnell.

The Best American Experimental Writing (BAX) anthology is an annual anthology of approximately 200 pages. BAX 2015 will be published by Wesleyan University Press in the fall. Read more about BAX and Wesleyan University Press here.

Pressnell received his MFA in poetry from West Virginia University in 2008. He began teaching at Graceland in 2011. His work has appeared in American Literary Review, Harpur Palate, Hotel Amerika, Indiana Review, Mid-American Review, Ninth Letter and many other journals.
