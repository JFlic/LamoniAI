One of the best things about living in Lamoni is the absolute beauty of the changing seasons. For anyone who has spent extended time on campus, you know that we can even experience almost all of the seasons in the span of a single week! As the seasons change, though, the strength of the Graceland experience remains. Brick buildings stand tall against the cold of winter, and our hearts stay warm as we reflect on experiences of the past year — new friends made, life changes, new careers, and even friends we have lost.

Graceland is on the cusp of a change of its own — and not just in the renovation of buildings like Newcom Student Union and Morden Center. Our administration, faculty and staff have been engaging in a months-long evaluation and planning process to transform our university to address the challenges of higher education that we see in the future. This transformation is leading us to a university that is dynamic and nimble while remaining true to the pillars of community and togetherness that have always made Graceland the special place we all know it to be.

As we work through this transformation, we celebrate the generosity of our amazing alumni and friends listed in the annual report for the 2018-19 fiscal year. I hope that you will take time to read the stories of our amazing community and see on full display the impact that this generosity has on our students.

Change is challenging, hard decisions need to be made, but it is also exciting. As the seasons change on our campuses, Graceland stands strong, poised to continue realizing its potential as a dynamic, comprehensive Midwestern university. Thank you for all you do to help make that happen — from your support and encouragement to your generosity of your resources. We are so grateful to have you as a part of our community.
